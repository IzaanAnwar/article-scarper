I had to ask my wife for help doing basic things like configuring our Wi-Fi router.)</p><p>After this, I was able to automate a lot of the rote back office tasks for my team.

I hung out with as many developers as I could, but I didn't know anyone else who was learning to code.</p><p>Everyone else had been coding for years, and they'd lost any memory of how hard it was to learn to code. So the entire time I felt alone and like an imposter.</p><p>My coding journey was also really winding. I went down so many blind alleys and learned tools I'd never use. I was spending days going in the wrong direction. I should have started building projects from month one, but I didn't really build anything until I'd been working through books and courses for several months.</p><p>Whenever I met other people who had successfully learned to code on their own, outside of university, their experience was similarly frustrating. That's when I knew - it's not just me - there are challenges that are inherent in learning to code mid-career.</p><p>I thought about all the people out there who would benefit from learning to code, and many of them were in a similar situation as me - with a family and a job, too busy to drop everything and focus on learning to code, and probably too resource-strapped to go back to university.</p><p>So from day one, I knew the program needed to be as convenient and accessible as possible. And that meant self-paced, browser-based, and free.</p><p>I built a basic prototype of freeCodeCamp in a few days, launched it, and did my best to publicize it by blogging and tweeting.</p><p>Miraculously, people started hanging out in freeCodeCamp's chat rooms and helping one another.
