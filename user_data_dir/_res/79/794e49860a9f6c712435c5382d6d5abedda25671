As developers, we keep using <a href=\"https://opensource.com/tags/javascript\">open source tools</a> because we do not want to reinvent the wheel. This makes development easier and faster for us, but at the same time it introduces possible vulnerabilities to our applications.</p>\n<p>The best we can do for ourselves is to continually verify the packages we use because the more dependencies we use, the more room there is for more vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Manually checking dependencies can be stressful and can increase development time. And going online to find out how vulnerable a package is before installing it can be time-consuming, especially for an application with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell\">many dependencies</a>.</p>\n<p>This is why we need automated tools to help us with this process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1retirejs\">1.
