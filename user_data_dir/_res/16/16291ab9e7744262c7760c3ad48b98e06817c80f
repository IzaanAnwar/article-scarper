Here is a diagrammatic guide to better understand how Redux\u2019s connect works with React.Let\u2019s say we have a Search component.And a classic Redux store.The Redux storeLet\u2019s populate the Redux store with Action dispatchers and the Reducer state.Redux store with Action dispatchers and the Reducer stateReducer\u2019s defaultStateThe Reducer\u2019s defaultState looks like this. The action parameter inside the Reducer function comes from the dispatchedAction.Connect React component to the Redux storeLet\u2019s connect the React search component with the Redux store. The React-Redux library has official React bindings for Redux.It provides the connect function to connect the component to the store.mapDispatchToProps means map the Action\u2019s dispatch function to React component\u2019s this.props .The same applies to mapStateToProps , where the Reducer\u2019s state is mapped to React component\u2019s this.props .React to Redux connect flowConnect React to Redux.The mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps deals with the Redux store\u2019s state and dispatch, respectively.Reducer\u2019s state and the Action\u2019s dispatch are available via this.props to the React component.Let us summarize the entire React to Redux connect workflow via a button click from the React search component.React to Redux connect flow via button clickClick the submit button on the React search componentThe click function dispatches an Action. The Action dispatch function is connected to the search component via mapDispatchToProps and is made available to this.props(out of scope for this post) The dispatched action is responsible to fetch data and dispatch another action to update the Reducer stateThe Reducer state updates itself with the new search data available from Step 3.The Reducer state is already connected to this.props in the search component via mapStateToPropsthis.props has the latest search data and the view now re-renders to show the updated search results\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n                        \n\n\n        Learn to code for free. freeCodeCamp's open source curriculum has helped more than 40,000 people get jobs as developers.
