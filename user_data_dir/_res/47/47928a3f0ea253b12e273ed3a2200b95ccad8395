IDE Meaning in Coding</h1>\n<section>\n<section data-test-label=\"post-content\">\n<p>When you're first learning to code, there are a few tools you'll typically want to decide on before getting started.</p>\n<p>You'll pick a tech stack and a programming language to learn and use, and you'll also choose an IDE, or integrated development environment, where you'll write your code.</p>\n<p>Many different types of IDEs are available today. Some work only online, while others work locally and possibly online. Some have specific features that help you write more precise and correct code, and so on.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn what an IDE is, what features an IDE can have, and what factors to consider when selecting an IDE for coding.</p>\n<p>Developers use an IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment, to write computer programs. You can write these computer programs in any language, including Python, Java, and many others.</p>\n<p>There are always tools that you'll use to help you achieve your goals in life. For example, a writer uses text editors such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs. An accountant uses spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. And a programmer uses IDEs.</p>\n<p>These IDEs increase your productivity by making writing, editing, debugging, and testing code easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can write code with text editors, but these text editors won't give you all the benefits an IDE can offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyuseanide\">Why Use an IDE?</h2>\n<p>Before IDEs were introduced, programmers used text editors such as Notepad to write code. They then saved that code using programming language extensions such as .php for PHP files and many more.</p>\n<p>However, these text editors were plain and lacked some features. This made writing, debugging, and running code difficult and time-consuming.</p>\n<p>This resulted in the development of the IDE, which includes some core functionality that extends beyond text editing, such as:</p>\n<h3 id=\"syntaxhighlighting\">Syntax Highlighting</h3>\n<p>An IDE detects the programming language and then applies specific colors, fonts, and styles to certain keywords, words, and text. This makes your code readable, clean, easier to detect syntax errors, and lots more.</p>\n<pre><code>// without syntax highlighting\n\nconst sayHello = () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Hello World\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>// with syntax highlighting\n\nconst sayHello = () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Hello World\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"autocompletion\">Auto Completion</h3>\n<p>When we type code in an IDE, a dropdown of possible suggestions appears from which we can select what we want. These helpful suggestions appear without us having to write the entire code, which can be slow and may result in a syntax error.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Animated GIF\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media2.giphy.com/media/8TB7KS8Q9vHIx1F9vC/giphy.gif?cid=790b761183e20bb773f96c56784399cc5608e9c3035aa750&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\" width=\"480\"/></p>\n<h3 id=\"easierdebugging\">Easier Debugging</h3>\n<p>Because programmers are humans, we are prone to making mistakes (bugs) in our code. These can be challenging to detect with text editors but can be easier with IDEs.</p>\n<p>When we run or test our code, an IDE will show us the errors, including the lines where they appear and potential solutions.</p>\n<p>This makes debugging (the process of fixing any errors or bugs discovered during testing) much more straightforward.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"s_110D5189045A36DC79B67893295C6233E2BEE4B4A7634435CBB07595B3BC257C_1662065625612_image\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_110D5189045A36DC79B67893295C6233E2BEE4B4A7634435CBB07595B3BC257C_1662065625612_image.png\" width=\"1952\"/></p>\n<p>There are many more reasons why you should use IDEs, such as the ability to easily compile your code and lots more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtochooseanideforcoding\">How to Choose an IDE for Coding</h2>\n<p>Having read this article to this point, the next question on your mind is likely - how do I choose an IDE?</p>\n<p>Don't worry, this doesn't have to be too complicated.

However, this IDE is incompatible with Windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thecost\">The cost</h3>\n<p>Even if most IDEs are free, the add-ons or customization features may not be.
