Note that once your chatbot is online on Facebook, you\u2019ll be able to modify it, and any changes you make to it will appear in your Messenger chat.</p><p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we won\u2019t go into how to create a chatbot. Instead, I warmly invite you to <a href=\"https://cai.tools.sap/signup\" rel=\"noopener\">create your account</a> (it\u2019s completely free!) and <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-first-chatbot-with-the-sap-conversational-ai-9a1a2bd44e3c\" rel=\"noopener\">read our tutorial</a>.</p><p>Once your \u201cjoke-telling chatbot\u201d (or whatever you\u2019ve built) is ready, return here!</p><h3 id=\"step-2-get-your-facebook-page-ready\">Step 2: Get your Facebook page ready</h3><p>Your chatbot will only be available for integration on a <strong>Facebook page</strong> (not on your personal profile). This means you have to create a Facebook page or have in mind the one you\u2019ll use. Let\u2019s assume your company, business, or group already has a page. (If that\u2019s not the case, hit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/pages\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a> and create one.)</p><p>As I said in the introduction, having a chatbot on a Facebook page will automate private messaging once it\u2019s connected to your page. Thus, if you decide to remove the chatbot, you\u2019ll immediately revert to traditional person-to-person conversations (which means nothing will happen when users enter a message until you manually answer them).</p><h3 id=\"step-3-create-a-messenger-facebook-app\">Step 3: Create a Messenger Facebook app</h3><p>Creating an app will help make the <strong>connection between SAP Conversational AI and your Facebook page</strong>.
