As more technologies come into being and advance, we need more tools that can make software for these technologies.</p><p>The programming languages we currently have might not be able to deal with specific problems that arise because of the nature of the languages' capabilities. The issue might be so unique that there are no existing solutions that address their needs, so people or companies decide to create a new language themselves.</p><p>Here are some notable examples of programming languages that developed from specific needs:</p><ol><li><strong>C</strong> \u2013 Dennis Ritchie and Bell Labs created C in 1972 to overcome older languages' problems. They first used it to run the Unix operating system. Today, it can run on almost all kinds of software and hardware.</li><li><strong>C++</strong> \u2013 Bjarne Stroustrup create C++ in 1985 for two main reasons. The first reason was to upgrade the features of the C programming language, and the second reason was to make it accessible for everyone to use in all fields.</li><li><strong>PHP</strong> \u2013 PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, and he initially used it for a personal project. Later he improved the language and released it to the public, and developers started using it heavily for web development.</li><li><strong>Go</strong> \u2013 Google created Go in 2009 because the languages they worked with at the time took were too slow and inconvenient for certain tasks. Also, Google wanted a programming language that was fast in performance but still relatively simple to read.</li><li><strong>JavaScript</strong> \u2013 Netscape created JavaScript in 1995. They initially created it for front end development so both web developers and designers could learn and create website features in a short timeframe. Now we use it for back end, front end, and mobile development.</li></ol><h2 id=\"different-kinds-of-developer-jobs-require-different-languages\">Different Kinds of Developer Jobs Require Different Languages</h2><p>Another reason we have so many programming languages is that there are different kinds of developer jobs out there that require different tools.</p><p>Think of it like a doctor and their patients. A doctor's job is to treat patients. There are different kinds of illness and injuries, and each one is complex enough to treat with different remedies. So doctors specialize in certain areas such as a cardiology, dentistry, surgery, and so on.</p><p>The same is true for programmers. As there are different kinds of software and platforms, each one requiring its own tools and features, programmers can specialize just like doctors.</p><p>Here are some developer jobs and the main programming languages they use:</p><ul><li>Game developers use C++ or C# to make video games for PCs and consoles.</li><li>Web developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to make websites and web applications.</li><li>Mobile app developers use Java and Kotlin to make Android applications or use Swift to make iOS applications.</li><li>Software developers use C++, C#, and Java to make desktop applications, business applications, and system software.</li><li>Data scientists use Python, R, and MatLab to analyze data for scientific research and educational purposes.</li></ul><p>These aren't the only languages you can use to perform these tasks. These are just examples of some of the most commonly used.</p><h2 id=\"developer-have-different-needs-and-goals-for-their-projects\">Developer Have Different Needs and Goals for their Projects</h2><p>The third reason there are so many programming languages is that not all of them will meet a developer or a company's goals. Different developers have their own goals and priorities, and some programming languages are better suited for certain types of tasks than others.</p><ul><li>Some developers want a programming language that's super fast and performant. Welcome Go or C++. These languages enable very granular control over system resources like memory and threads.</li><li>Other developers want a programming language that can build the program in a few days and not weeks. Say hello to JavaScript! It's hard to find a more versatile language. You can <a href=\"https://learn.coderslang.com/0102-what-can-i-do-with-javascript/\">use JS everywhere from the backend to web and mobile apps</a>.</li><li>Then some developers prefer a programming language for a specific task.

What type of programming job do you want to work in? What do you want to build? What do job postings require in your area? Once you look at these factors, you can pick a programming language that helps you achieve your goal.For example, if your goal is to make a professional website, then learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you want to break into game development, then go for C++ and C#.
