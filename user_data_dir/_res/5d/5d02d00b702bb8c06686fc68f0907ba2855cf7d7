When you write code in the new style, it will also improve your reading skills. The style will feel less foreign, as you've actually experienced it. Even if I'm just browsing a random project on Github, I'll quickly do this.

I figured it was just a matter of time and effort before I also wrote \"perfect\" code.<br/>It's something I used to feel really anxious about.

There will be rare cases where you need to meet a deadline or pull a little extra for a stretch, but those are few and far between. When I say \"rare\", I mean almost never.
