I started creating my own <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412#.5fwwphdqd\" rel=\"noopener\">data science master\u2019s program</a> using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>I\u2019m almost finished now. I\u2019ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role.<strong> </strong>So I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.</p><p>For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.42hhzxopw\" rel=\"noopener\">coding classes</a> for the beginner data scientist. Then it was <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9#.p7pac546r\" rel=\"noopener\">statistics and probability classes</a>. Then <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e\" rel=\"noopener\">introductions to data science</a>. Also, <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/an-overview-of-every-data-visualization-course-on-the-internet-9ccf24ea9c9b\" rel=\"noopener\">data visualization</a>.</p><h3 id=\"now-onto-machine-learning-\">Now onto machine learning.</h3><p>For this guide, I spent a dozen hours trying to identify every online machine learning course offered as of May 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. <strong>My end goal was to identify the three best courses available and present them to you, below.</strong></p><p>For this task, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community, and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.</p><figure><img alt=\"1*u1dxHyShejSN3cgXGFQIAA\" height=\"482\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*u1dxHyShejSN3cgXGFQIAA.png\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>Class Central\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">homepage</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Since 2011, <a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Class Central</a> founder <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-single-machine-learning-course-on-the-internet-ranked-by-your-reviews-3c4a7b8026c0/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">Dhawal Shah</a> has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.</p><h3 id=\"how-we-picked-courses-to-consider\">How we picked courses to consider</h3><p>Each course must fit three criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>It must have a significant amount of machine learning content.</strong> Ideally, machine learning is the primary topic.<strong> </strong>Note that deep learning-only courses are excluded. More on that later.</li><li><strong>It must be on-demand or offered every few months.</strong></li><li><strong>It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials</strong>. Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses. Courses that are strictly videos (i.e. with no quizzes, assignments, etc.) are also excluded.</li></ol><p>We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;u1=medium-career-guide-machine-learning&amp;tmpid=14494&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.udemy.com%252F\" rel=\"noopener\">Udemy</a>, we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only.</p><p>There\u2019s always a chance that we missed something, though. So please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.</p><h3 id=\"how-we-evaluated-courses\">How we evaluated courses</h3><p>We compiled average ratings and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.</p><p>We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on three factors:</p><ol><li><strong>Explanation of the machine learning workflow. </strong>Does the course outline the steps required for executing a successful ML project? See the next section for what a typical workflow entails.</li><li><strong>Coverage of machine learning techniques and algorithms.</strong> Are a variety of techniques (e.g. regression, classification, clustering, etc.) and algorithms (e.g. within classification: naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.) covered or just a select few? Preference is given to courses that cover more without skimping on detail.</li><li><strong>Usage of common data science and machine learning tools.</strong> Is the course taught using popular programming languages like Python, R, and/or Scala? How about popular libraries within those languages? These aren\u2019t necessary, but helpful so slight preference is given to these courses.</li></ol><h3 id=\"what-is-machine-learning-what-is-a-workflow\">What is machine learning? What is a workflow?</h3><p>A popular definition originates from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel\" rel=\"noopener\">Arthur Samuel</a> in 1959: machine learning is a subfield of computer science that gives <em>\u201ccomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\u201d</em> In practice, this means developing computer programs that can make predictions based on data. Just as humans can learn from experience, so can computers, where data = experience.</p><p>A machine learning workflow is the process required for carrying out a machine learning project. Though individual projects can differ, most workflows share several common tasks: problem evaluation, data exploration, data preprocessing, model training/testing/deployment, etc. Below you\u2019ll find helpful visualization of these core steps:</p><figure><img alt=\"1*KzmIUYPmxgEHhXX7SlbP4w\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*KzmIUYPmxgEHhXX7SlbP4w.jpeg\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>The core steps of typical machine learning workflow, <a href=\"https://upxacademy.com/introduction-machine-learning/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">via UpX Academy</a></figcaption></figure><p>The ideal course introduces the entire process and provides interactive examples, assignments, and/or quizzes where students can perform each task themselves.</p><h3 id=\"do-these-courses-cover-deep-learning\">Do these courses cover deep learning?</h3><p>First off, let\u2019s define deep learning. Here is a succinct description:</p><blockquote>\u201cDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.\u201d</blockquote><blockquote>\u2014 Jason Brownlee from <a href=\"http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Learning Mastery</a></blockquote><p>As would be expected, portions of some of the machine learning courses contain deep learning content. I chose not to include deep learning-only courses, however. If you are interested in deep learning specifically, we\u2019ve got you covered with the following <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/dive-into-deep-learning-with-these-23-online-courses-bf247d289cc0\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/dive-into-deep-learning-with-these-23-online-courses-bf247d289cc0\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Dive into Deep Learning with 12 free online courses</strong></a><br/><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/dive-into-deep-learning-with-these-23-online-courses-bf247d289cc0\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Every day brings new headlines for how deep learning is changing the world around us.

These prerequisites are understandable given that machine learning is an advanced discipline.</p><p>Missing a few subjects? Good news! Some of this experience can be acquired through our recommendations in the first two articles (<a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.ld31z08y5\" rel=\"noopener\">programming</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9\" rel=\"noopener\">statistics</a>) of this Data Science Career Guide. Several top-ranked courses below also provide gentle calculus and linear algebra refreshers and highlight the aspects most relevant to machine learning for those less familiar.</p><h3 id=\"our-pick-for-the-best-machine-learning-course-is-\">Our pick for the best machine learning course is\u2026</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/mooc/835/coursera-machine-learning\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Learning</a> (Stanford University via Coursera)</li></ul><p>Stanford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/mooc/835/coursera-machine-learning\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Learning</a> on Coursera is the clear current winner in terms of ratings, reviews, and syllabus fit. Taught by the famous Andrew Ng, Google Brain founder and former chief scientist at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu\" rel=\"noopener\">Baidu</a>, this was the class that sparked the founding of Coursera. It has a 4.7-star weighted average rating over 422 reviews.</p><p>Released in 2011, it covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow. Though it has a smaller scope than the original Stanford class upon which it is based, it still manages to cover a large number of techniques and algorithms. The estimated timeline is eleven weeks, with two weeks dedicated to neural networks and deep learning. Free and paid options are available.</p><p>Ng is a dynamic yet gentle instructor with a palpable experience. He inspires confidence, especially when sharing practical implementation tips and warnings about common pitfalls. A linear algebra refresher is provided and Ng highlights the aspects of calculus most relevant to machine learning.</p><p>Evaluation is automatic and is done via multiple choice quizzes that follow each lesson and programming assignments. The assignments (there are eight of them) can be completed in MATLAB or Octave, which is an open-source version of MATLAB. Ng explains his language choice:</p><blockquote>In the past, I\u2019ve tried to teach machine learning using a large variety of different programming languages including C++, Java, Python, NumPy, and also Octave \u2026 And what I\u2019ve seen after having taught machine learning for almost a decade is that you learn much faster if you use Octave as your programming environment.</blockquote><p>Though Python and R are likely more compelling choices in 2017 with the <a href=\"http://blog.codeeval.com/codeevalblog/2016/2/2/most-popular-coding-languages-of-2016\" rel=\"noopener\">increased popularity of those languages</a>, reviewers note that that shouldn\u2019t stop you from taking the course.</p><p>A few prominent reviewers noted the following:</p><blockquote>Of longstanding renown in the MOOC world, Stanford\u2019s machine learning course really is the definitive introduction to this topic. The course broadly covers all of the major areas of machine learning \u2026 Prof. Ng precedes each segment with a motivating discussion and examples.<p>Andrew Ng is a gifted teacher and able to explain complicated subjects in a very intuitive and clear way, including the math behind all concepts. Highly recommended.</p><p>The only problem I see with this course if that it sets the expectation bar very high for other courses.</p></blockquote><figure><img alt=\"1*viCB-ayFFQi-4Fs_NYLVVQ\" height=\"168\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*viCB-ayFFQi-4Fs_NYLVVQ.png\" width=\"800\"/></figure><h3 id=\"a-new-ivy-league-introduction-with-a-brilliant-professor\">A new Ivy League introduction with a brilliant professor</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/mooc/7231/edx-machine-learning\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Learning</a> (Columbia University via edX)</li></ul><p>Columbia University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.class-central.com/mooc/7231/edx-machine-learning\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Learning</a> is a relatively new offering that is part of their Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters on edX. Though it is newer and doesn\u2019t have a large number of reviews, the ones that it does have are exceptionally strong. Professor John Paisley is noted as brilliant, clear, and clever. It has a 4.8-star weighted average rating over 10 reviews.</p><p>The course also covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow and more algorithms than the above Stanford offering. Columbia\u2019s is a more advanced introduction, with reviewers noting that students should be comfortable with the recommended prerequisites (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability, and coding).</p><p>Quizzes (11), programming assignments (4), and a final exam are the modes of evaluation. Students can use either Python, Octave, or MATLAB to complete the assignments. The course\u2019s total estimated timeline is eight to ten hours per week over twelve weeks. It is free with a verified certificate available for purchase.</p><p>Below are a few of the aforementioned sparkling <a href=\"https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/machine-learning-5\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a>:</p><blockquote>Over all my years of [being a] student I\u2019ve come across professors who aren\u2019t brilliant, professors who are brilliant but they don\u2019t know how to explain the stuff clearly, and professors who are brilliant and know how explain the stuff clearly. Dr. Paisley belongs to the third group.<p>This is a great course \u2026 The instructor\u2019s language is precise and that is, to my mind, one of the strongest points of the course. The lectures are of high quality and the slides are great too.</p><p>Dr. Paisley and his supervisor are \u2026 students of Michael Jordan, the father of machine learning.

I started creating my own data science master\u2019s program using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.I\u2019m almost finished now. I\u2019ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role. So I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few coding classes for the beginner data scientist. Then it was statistics and probability classes. Then introductions to data science. Also, data visualization.Now onto machine learning.For this guide, I spent a dozen hours trying to identify every online machine learning course offered as of May 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. My end goal was to identify the three best courses available and present them to you, below.For this task, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community, and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.Class Central\u2019s homepage.Since 2011, Class Central founder Dhawal Shah has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.How we picked courses to considerEach course must fit three criteria:It must have a significant amount of machine learning content. Ideally, machine learning is the primary topic. Note that deep learning-only courses are excluded. More on that later.It must be on-demand or offered every few months.It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials. Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses. Courses that are strictly videos (i.e. with no quizzes, assignments, etc.) are also excluded.We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on Udemy, we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only.There\u2019s always a chance that we missed something, though. So please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.How we evaluated coursesWe compiled average ratings and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on three factors:Explanation of the machine learning workflow. Does the course outline the steps required for executing a successful ML project? See the next section for what a typical workflow entails.Coverage of machine learning techniques and algorithms. Are a variety of techniques (e.g. regression, classification, clustering, etc.) and algorithms (e.g. within classification: naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.) covered or just a select few? Preference is given to courses that cover more without skimping on detail.Usage of common data science and machine learning tools. Is the course taught using popular programming languages like Python, R, and/or Scala? How about popular libraries within those languages? These aren\u2019t necessary, but helpful so slight preference is given to these courses.What is machine learning? What is a workflow?A popular definition originates from Arthur Samuel in 1959: machine learning is a subfield of computer science that gives \u201ccomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\u201d In practice, this means developing computer programs that can make predictions based on data. Just as humans can learn from experience, so can computers, where data = experience.A machine learning workflow is the process required for carrying out a machine learning project. Though individual projects can differ, most workflows share several common tasks: problem evaluation, data exploration, data preprocessing, model training/testing/deployment, etc. Below you\u2019ll find helpful visualization of these core steps:The core steps of typical machine learning workflow, via UpX AcademyThe ideal course introduces the entire process and provides interactive examples, assignments, and/or quizzes where students can perform each task themselves.Do these courses cover deep learning?First off, let\u2019s define deep learning. Here is a succinct description:\u201cDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.\u201d\u2014 Jason Brownlee from Machine Learning MasteryAs would be expected, portions of some of the machine learning courses contain deep learning content. I chose not to include deep learning-only courses, however. If you are interested in deep learning specifically, we\u2019ve got you covered with the following article:Dive into Deep Learning with 12 free online coursesEvery day brings new headlines for how deep learning is changing the world around us. A few examples:medium.freecodecamp.comMy top three recommendations from that list would be:Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow by KadenzeNeural Networks for Machine Learning by the University of Toronto (taught by Geoffrey Hinton) via CourseraDeep Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networksby Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves, and the SuperDataScience Team via UdemyRecommended prerequisitesSeveral courses listed below ask students to have prior programming, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics experience. These prerequisites are understandable given that machine learning is an advanced discipline.Missing a few subjects? Good news! Some of this experience can be acquired through our recommendations in the first two articles (programming, statistics) of this Data Science Career Guide. Several top-ranked courses below also provide gentle calculus and linear algebra refreshers and highlight the aspects most relevant to machine learning for those less familiar.Our pick for the best machine learning course is\u2026Machine Learning (Stanford University via Coursera)Stanford University\u2019s Machine Learning on Coursera is the clear current winner in terms of ratings, reviews, and syllabus fit. Taught by the famous Andrew Ng, Google Brain founder and former chief scientist at Baidu, this was the class that sparked the founding of Coursera. It has a 4.7-star weighted average rating over 422 reviews.Released in 2011, it covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow. Though it has a smaller scope than the original Stanford class upon which it is based, it still manages to cover a large number of techniques and algorithms. The estimated timeline is eleven weeks, with two weeks dedicated to neural networks and deep learning. Free and paid options are available.Ng is a dynamic yet gentle instructor with a palpable experience. He inspires confidence, especially when sharing practical implementation tips and warnings about common pitfalls. A linear algebra refresher is provided and Ng highlights the aspects of calculus most relevant to machine learning.Evaluation is automatic and is done via multiple choice quizzes that follow each lesson and programming assignments. The assignments (there are eight of them) can be completed in MATLAB or Octave, which is an open-source version of MATLAB. Ng explains his language choice:In the past, I\u2019ve tried to teach machine learning using a large variety of different programming languages including C++, Java, Python, NumPy, and also Octave \u2026 And what I\u2019ve seen after having taught machine learning for almost a decade is that you learn much faster if you use Octave as your programming environment.Though Python and R are likely more compelling choices in 2017 with the increased popularity of those languages, reviewers note that that shouldn\u2019t stop you from taking the course.A few prominent reviewers noted the following:Of longstanding renown in the MOOC world, Stanford\u2019s machine learning course really is the definitive introduction to this topic. The course broadly covers all of the major areas of machine learning \u2026 Prof. Ng precedes each segment with a motivating discussion and examples.Andrew Ng is a gifted teacher and able to explain complicated subjects in a very intuitive and clear way, including the math behind all concepts. Highly recommended.The only problem I see with this course if that it sets the expectation bar very high for other courses.A new Ivy League introduction with a brilliant professorMachine Learning (Columbia University via edX)Columbia University\u2019s Machine Learning is a relatively new offering that is part of their Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters on edX. Though it is newer and doesn\u2019t have a large number of reviews, the ones that it does have are exceptionally strong. Professor John Paisley is noted as brilliant, clear, and clever. It has a 4.8-star weighted average rating over 10 reviews.The course also covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow and more algorithms than the above Stanford offering. Columbia\u2019s is a more advanced introduction, with reviewers noting that students should be comfortable with the recommended prerequisites (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability, and coding).Quizzes (11), programming assignments (4), and a final exam are the modes of evaluation. Students can use either Python, Octave, or MATLAB to complete the assignments. The course\u2019s total estimated timeline is eight to ten hours per week over twelve weeks. It is free with a verified certificate available for purchase.Below are a few of the aforementioned sparkling reviews:Over all my years of [being a] student I\u2019ve come across professors who aren\u2019t brilliant, professors who are brilliant but they don\u2019t know how to explain the stuff clearly, and professors who are brilliant and know how explain the stuff clearly. Dr. Paisley belongs to the third group.This is a great course \u2026 The instructor\u2019s language is precise and that is, to my mind, one of the strongest points of the course. The lectures are of high quality and the slides are great too.Dr. Paisley and his supervisor are \u2026 students of Michael Jordan, the father of machine learning. [Dr. Paisley] is the best ML professor at Columbia because of his ability to explain stuff clearly. Up to 240 students have selected his course this semester, the largest number among all professors [teaching] machine learning at Columbia.A practical intro in Python & R from industry expertsMachine Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science (Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves, and the SuperDataScience Team via Udemy)Machine Learning A-Z\u2122 on Udemy is an impressively detailed offering that provides instruction in both Python and R, which is rare and can\u2019t be said for any of the other top courses. It has a 4.5-star weighted average rating over 8,119 reviews, which makes it the most reviewed course of the ones considered.It covers the entire machine learning workflow and an almost ridiculous (in a good way) number of algorithms through 40.5 hours of on-demand video. The course takes a more applied approach and is lighter math-wise than the above two courses. Each section starts with an \u201cintuition\u201d video from Eremenko that summarizes the underlying theory of the concept being taught. de Ponteves then walks through implementation with separate videos for both Python and R.As a \u201cbonus,\u201d the course includes Python and R code templates for students to download and use on their own projects. There are quizzes and homework challenges, though these aren\u2019t the strong points of the course.Eremenko and the SuperDataScience team are revered for their ability to \u201cmake the complex simple.\u201d Also, the prerequisites listed are \u201cjust some high school mathematics,\u201d so this course might be a better option for those daunted by the Stanford and Columbia offerings.A few prominent reviewers noted the following:The course is professionally produced, the sound quality is excellent, and the explanations are clear and concise \u2026 It\u2019s an incredible value for your financial and time investment.It was spectacular to be able to follow the course in two different programming languages simultaneously.Kirill is one of the absolute best instructors on Udemy (if not the Internet) and I recommend taking any class he teaches. \u2026 This course has a ton of content, like a ton!The competitionOur #1 pick had a weighted average rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars over 422 reviews.
