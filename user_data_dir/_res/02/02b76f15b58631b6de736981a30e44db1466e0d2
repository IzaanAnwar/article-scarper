Let's see why. I'm sure that you will be greatly surprised. </p><p>Every time you turn on your smartphone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, or any other electronic device, you are running code that was planned, developed, and written by developers. This code creates the final and interactive result that you can see on your screen.</p><p>That is exactly what <strong>programming</strong> is all about. It is the process of writing code to solve a particular problem or to implement a particular task. </p><p>Programming is what allows your computer to run the programs you use every day and your smartphone to run the apps that you love. It is an essential part of our world as we know it. </p><p>Whenever you check your calendar, attend virtual conferences, browse the web, or edit a document, you are using <strong>code</strong> that has been written by developers. </p><p>\"And what is code?\" you may ask.</p><p><strong>Code</strong> is a sequence of instructions that a programmer writes to tell a device (like a computer) what to do. </p><p>The device cannot know by itself how to handle a particular situation or how to perform a task. So developers are in charge of analyzing the situation and writing explicit instructions to implement what is needed. </p><p>To do this, they follow a particular syntax (a set of rules for writing the code).</p><p>A <strong>developer</strong> (or programmer) is the person who analyzes a problem and implements a solution in code.</p><p>Sounds amazing, right? It's very powerful and <strong>you</strong> can be part this wonderful world too by learning how to code. Let's see how.</p><h3 id=\"you-as-a-developer-\">You, as a developer. </h3><p>Let's put you in a developer's shoes for a moment. Imagine that you are developing a mobile app, like the ones that you probably have installed on your smartphone right now. </p><p>What is the first thing that you would do? </p><p>Think about this for a moment.</p><p>The answer is...</p><p>Analyzing the problem. What are you trying to build?</p><p>As a developer, you would start by designing the layout of the app, how it will work, its different screens and functionality, and all the small details that will make your app an awesome tool for users around the world. </p><p>Only after you have everything carefully planned out, you can start to write your code. To do that, you will need to choose a <strong>programming language</strong> to work with. Let's see what a programming language is and why they are super important. </p><h2 id=\"-what-is-a-programing-language\">\ud83d\udd38 What is a Programing Language?</h2><figure><img alt=\"what-is-a-programming-language\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/><figcaption>Logos of popular programming languages.</figcaption></figure><p>A <strong>programming language</strong> is a language that computers can understand. </p><p>We cannot just write English words in our program like this:</p><blockquote>\"Computer, solve this task!\"</blockquote><p>and hope that our computer can understand what we mean. We need to follow certain rules to write the instructions. </p><p>Every programming language has its own set of rules that determine if a line of code is valid or not. Because of this, the code you write in one programming language will be slightly different from others. </p><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip:</strong> Some programming languages are more complex than others but most of them share core concepts and functionality. If you learn how to code in one programming language, you will likely be able to learn another one faster.</p><p>Before you can start writing awesome programs and apps, you need to learn the basic rules of the programming language you chose for the task. </p><p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Tip:</strong> a <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions written in a programming language for the computer to execute. We usually write the code for our program in one or multiple files.</p><p>For example, this is a line of code in Python (a very popular programming language) that shows the message <code>\"Hello, World!\"</code>:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>print(\"Hello, World!\")</code></pre><p>But if we write the same line of code in JavaScript (a programming language mainly used for web development), we will get an error because it will not be valid.</p><p>To do something very similar in JavaScript, we would write this line of code instead:</p><pre><code>console.log(\"Hello, World!\");</code></pre><p>Visually, they look very different, right? This is because Python and JavaScript have a different syntax and a different set of <strong>built-in functions</strong>.</p><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip</strong>: <strong>built-in functions</strong> are basically tasks that are already defined in the programming language. This lets us use them directly in our code by writing their names and by specifying the values they need. \u00a0</p><p>In our examples, <code><strong>print()</strong></code> is a built-in function in Python while <code><strong>console.log()</strong></code> is a function that we can use in JavaScript to see the message in the console (an interactive tool) if we run our code in the browser. </p><p>Examples of programming languages include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, C#, C++, PHP, Go, Swift, SQL, and R. There are many programming languages and most of them can be used for many different purposes. </p><p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Tip: </strong>These were the most popular programming languages on the <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language\">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022</a>:</p><figure><img alt=\"Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM\" height=\"1418\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 2064w\" width=\"2064\"/><figcaption>The 14 most popular programming languages among all respondents of the <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language\">StackOverflow Developer Survey 2022</a>.

Some of them have broader applications like Python and JavaScript while others (like R) have more specific (and even scientific) purposes. </p><p>This sounds very interesting, right? And we are only starting to talk about programming languages. There is a lot to learn about them and I promise you that if you dive deeper into programming, your time and effort will be totally worth it. </p><p>Awesome! Now that you know what programming is and what programming languages are all about, let's see how programming is related to binary numbers. </p><h2 id=\"-programming-and-binary-numbers\">\ud83d\udd39 Programming and Binary Numbers</h2><p>When you think about programming, perhaps the first thing that comes to your mind is something like the below image, right? A sequence of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s on your computer. </p><figure><img alt=\"binary\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/binary.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/binary.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/binary.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/binary.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/><figcaption>Binary numbers are 0 and 1.</figcaption></figure><p>Programming is indeed related to binary numbers ( <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>) but in an indirect way. Developers do not actually write their code using zeros and ones. </p><p>We usually write programs in a high-level programming language, a programming language with a syntax that recognizes specific words (called keywords), symbols, and values of different data types. </p><p>Basically, we write code in a way that humans can understand.</p><p>For example, these are the keywords that we can use in Python:</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>False               class               from                or\nNone                continue            global              pass\nTrue                def                 if                  raise\nand                 del                 import              return\nas                  elif                in                  try\nassert              else                is                  while\nasync               except              lambda              with\nawait               finally             nonlocal            yield\nbreak               for                 not </code></pre><figcaption>List of Python keywords.</figcaption></figure><p>Every programming language has its own set of keywords (words written in English). These keywords are part of the syntax and core functionality of the programming language. </p><p>But keywords are just common words in English, almost like the ones that we would find in a book.</p><p>That leads us to two very important questions:</p><ul><li>How does the computer understand and interpret what we are trying to say?</li><li>Where does the binary number system come into play here?</li></ul><p>The computer does <strong>not</strong> understand these words, symbols, or values directly. </p><p>When a program runs, the code that we write in a high-level programming language that humans can understand is automatically transformed into binary code that the computer can understand. </p><figure><img alt=\"11---binary-diagram\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/><figcaption>Process of transforming a program into binary code.</figcaption></figure><p>This transformation of source code that humans can understand into binary code that the computer can understand is called <strong>compilation</strong>. </p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/compiler\">Britannica</a>, a <strong>compiler</strong> is defined as:</p><blockquote>Computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer\u2019s CPU.</blockquote><p>Britannica also mentions that:</p><blockquote>The term <em>compiler</em> was coined by American computer scientist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Grace-Hopper\">Grace Hopper</a>, who designed one of the first compilers in the early 1950s.</blockquote><p>Some programming languages can be classified as <strong>compiled</strong> programming languages while others can be classified as <strong>interpreted</strong> programming languages based on how to they are transformed into machine-language instructions. </p><p>However, they all have to go through a process that converts them into instructions that the computer can understand. </p><p>Awesome. Now you know why binary code is so important for computer science. Without it, basically programming would not exist because computers would not be able to understand our instructions. </p><p>Now let's dive into the applications of programming and the different areas that you can explore. </p><h2 id=\"-real-world-applications-of-programming\">\ud83d\udd38 Real-World Applications of Programming</h2><figure><img alt=\"applications\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/applications.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/applications.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/applications.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/applications.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/><figcaption>Programming has many real-world applications in basically every industry that you can imagine.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><p>Programming has many different applications in many different industries.

Now let's dive into the soft skills that you need to become a successful programmer. </p><h2 id=\"-skills-of-a-successful-programmer\">\ud83d\udd39 Skills of a Successful Programmer</h2><figure><img alt=\"skills\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/skills.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/skills.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/skills.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/skills.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>After going through the diverse range of applications of programming, you must be curious to know what skills are needed to succeed in this field. </p><h3 id=\"curiosity\">Curiosity</h3><p>A programmer should be curious. Whether you are just starting to learn how to code or you already have 20 years of experience, coding projects will always present you with new challenges and learning opportunities. If you take these opportunities, you will continously improve your skills and succeed. </p><h3 id=\"enthusiasm\">Enthusiasm</h3><p>Enthusiasm is a key trait of a successful programmer but this applies in general to any field if you want to succeed. Enthusiasm will keep you happy and curious about what you are creating and learning. </p><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip: </strong>If you ever feel like you are not as enthusiastic as you used to be, it's time to find or learn something new that can light the spark in you again and fill you with hope and dreams.</p><h3 id=\"patience\">Patience</h3><p>A programmer must be patient because transforming an initial idea into a working product can take time, effort, and many different steps. Patience will keep you focused on your final goal. \u00a0</p><h3 id=\"resilience\">Resilience</h3><p>Programming can be challenging. That is true. But what defines you is not how many challenges you face, it's how you face them. If you thrive despite these challenges, you will become a better programmer and you could create something that could change the world. </p><h3 id=\"creativity\">Creativity</h3><p>Programmers must be creative because even though every programming language has a particular set of rules for writing the code, coding is like using LEGOs. You have the building-blocks but you need to decide what to create and how to create it. The process of writing the code requires creativity while following the established best practices.</p><h3 id=\"problem-solving-and-analysis\">Problem-solving and Analysis</h3><p>Programming is basically analyzing and solving problems with code. Depending on your field of choice, those problems will be simpler or more complex but they will all require some level of problem-solving skills and a thorough analysis of the situation. </p><p>Questions like:</p><ul><li>What should I build?</li><li>How can I build it?</li><li>What is the best way to build this?</li></ul><p>Are part of the everyday routine of a programmer.</p><h3 id=\"ability-to-focus-for-long-periods-of-time\">Ability to Focus for Long Periods of Time</h3><p>When you are working on a coding project, you will need to focus on a task for long periods of time. From creating the design, to planning and writing the code, to testing the result, and to fixing bugs (issues with the code), you will dedicate many hours to a particular task. This is why it's essential to be able to focus and to keep your final goal in mind. </p><h3 id=\"taking-detailed-notes\">Taking Detailed Notes</h3><p>This skill is very important for programmers, particularly when you are learning how to code. Taking detailed notes can be help you to understand and remember the concepts and tools you learn. This also applies for experienced programmers, since being a programmer involves life-long learning. </p><h3 id=\"communication\">Communication</h3><p>Initially, you might think that programming is a solitary activity and imagine that a programmer spends hundreds of hours alone sitting on a desk. </p><p>But the reality is that when you find your first job, you will see that communication is super important to coordinate tasks with other team members and to exchange ideas and feedback.</p><h3 id=\"open-to-feedback\">Open to Feedback</h3><p>In programming, there is usually more than one way to implement the same functionality. Different alternatives may work similarly, but some may be easier to read or more efficient in terms of time or resource consumption. </p><p>When you are learning how to code, you should always take constructive feedback as a tool for learning. Similarly, when you are working on a team, take your colleagues' feedback positively and always try to improve. </p><h3 id=\"life-long-learning\">Life-long Learning</h3><p>Programming equals life-long learning. If you are interested in learning how to code, you must know that you will always need to be learning new things as new technologies emerge and existing technologies are updated. Think about it... that is great because there is always something interesting and new to learn!</p><h3 id=\"open-to-trying-new-things\">Open to Trying New Things</h3><p>Finally, an essential skill to be a successful programmer is to be open to trying new things. Step out of your comfort zone and be open to new technologies and products. In the technology industry, things evolve very quickly and adapting to change is essential. </p><h2 id=\"-tips-for-learning-how-to-code\">\ud83d\udd38 Tips for Learning How to Code</h2><figure><img alt=\"tips\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/tips.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/tips.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/tips.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/tips.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Now that you know more about programming, programming languages, and the skills you need to be a successful programmer, let's see some tips for learning how to code. </p><p>\ud83d\udca1<strong> Tip: </strong>these tips are based on my personal experience and opinions. </p><ul><li><strong>Choose one programming language to learn first.</strong> When you are learning how to code, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the number of options and entry paths. My advice would be to focus on understanding the essential computer science concepts and one programming language first. Python and JavaScript are great options to start learning the fundamentals. </li><li><strong>Take detailed notes.</strong> Note-taking skills are essential to record and to analyze the topics you are learning. You can add custom comments and annotations to explain what you are learning. </li><li><strong>Practice constantly.</strong> You can only improve your problem-solving skills by practicing and by learning new techniques and tools. Try to practice every day. </li></ul><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip:</strong> There is a challenge called the <a href=\"https://www.100daysofcode.com/\">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge that you can join to practice every day. \u00a0</p><ul><li><strong>Always try again.</strong> If you can't solve a problem on your first try, take a break and come back again and again until you solve it. That is the only way to learn. Learn from your mistakes and learn new approaches. </li><li><strong>Learn how to research and how to find answers. </strong>Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks usually have official documentations that explain their built-in elements and tools and how you can use them. This is a precious resource that you should definitely refer to. </li><li><strong>Browse <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>.</strong> This is an amazing platform. It is like an online encyclopedia of answers to common programming questions. You can find answers to existing questions and ask new questions to get help from the community. </li><li><strong>Set goals.</strong> Motivation is one of the most important factors for success. Setting goals is very important to keep you focused, motivated, and enthusiastic. Once you reach your goals, set new ones that you find challenging and exciting.</li><li><strong>Create projects. </strong>When you are learning how to code, applying your skills will help you to expand your knowledge and remember things better. Creating projects is the perfect way to practice and to create a portfolio that you can show to potential employers. </li></ul><h2 id=\"-basic-programming-concepts\">\ud83d\udd39 Basic Programming Concepts</h2><figure><img alt=\"basic-concepts\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/basic-concepts.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Great. If reading this article has helped you confirm that you want to learn programming, let's take your first steps. </p><p>These are some basic programming concepts that you should know:</p><ul><li><strong>Variable: </strong>a variable is a name that we assign to a value in a computer program. When we define a variable, we assign a value to a name and we allocate a space in memory to store that value. The value of a variable can be updated during the program. </li><li><strong>Constant:</strong> a constant is similar to a variable. It stores a value but it cannot be modified. Once you assign a value to a constant, you cannot change it during the entire program. </li><li><strong>Conditional:</strong> a conditional is a programming structure that lets developers choose what the computer should do based on a condition. If the condition is True, something will happen but if the condition is False, something different can happen. </li><li><strong>Loop: </strong>a loop is a programming structure that let us run a code block (a sequence of instructions) multiple times. They are super helpful to avoid code repetition and to implement more complex functionality.</li><li><strong>Function: </strong>a function helps us to avoid code repetition and to reuse our code. It is like a code block to which we assign a name but it also has some special characteristics. We can write the name of the function to run that sequence of instructions without writing them again. </li></ul><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip:</strong> Functions can communicate with main programs and main programs can communicate with functions through <strong>parameters</strong>, <strong>arguments</strong>, and <strong>return</strong> statements. </p><ul><li><strong>Class:</strong> a class is used as a blueprint to define the characteristics and functionality of a type of object. Just like we have objects in our real world, we can represent objects in our programs.</li><li><strong>Bug:</strong> a bug is an error in the logic or implementation of a program that results in an unexpected or incorrect output. </li><li><strong>Debugging: </strong>debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in a program. </li><li><strong>IDE: </strong>this acronym stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software development environment that has the most helpful tools that you will need to write computer programs such as a file editor, an explorer, a terminal, and helpful menu options. </li></ul><p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Tip:</strong> a commonly used and free IDE is <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, created by Microsoft. </p><p>Awesome! Now you know some of the fundamental concepts in programming. Like you learned, each programming language has a different syntax, but they all share most of these programming structures and concepts. \u00a0</p><h2 id=\"-types-of-programming-languages\">\ud83d\udd38 Types of Programming Languages</h2><figure><img alt=\"types-of-programming-languages\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 1280w\" width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Programming languages can be classified based on different criteria. If you want to learn how to code, it's important for you to learn these basic classifications:</p><h3 id=\"complexity\">Complexity</h3><ul><li><strong>High-level programming languages:</strong> they are designed to be understood by humans and they have to be converted into machine code before the computer can understand them. They are the programming languages that we commonly use. For example: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, and Kotlin.</li><li><strong>Low-level programming languages: </strong>they are more difficult to understand because they are not designed for humans. They are designed to be understood and processed efficiently by machines.</li></ul><h3 id=\"conversion-into-machine-code\">Conversion into Machine Code</h3><ul><li><strong>Compiled programming languages:</strong> programs written with this type of programming language are converted directly into machine code by a compiler. Examples include C, C++, Haskell, and Go. </li><li><strong>Interpreted programming languages:</strong> programs written with this type of programming language rely on another program called the <strong>interpreter, </strong>which is in charge of running the code line by line. Examples include Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby. </li></ul><p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Tip:</strong> according to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/\">this article</a> on freeCodeCamp's publication:</p><blockquote>Most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations \u2013 the language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted. However, for simplicity\u2019s sake, they\u2019re typically referred to as such.</blockquote><p>There are other types of programming languages based on different criteria, such as:</p><ul><li>Procedural programming languages</li><li>Functional programming languages</li><li>Object-oriented programming languages</li><li>Scripting languages</li><li>Logic programming languages</li></ul><p>And the list of types of programming languages continues. This is very interesting because you can analyze the characteristics of a programming language to help you choose the right one for your project. </p><h2 id=\"-how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects\">\ud83d\udd39 How to Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2><figure><img alt=\"Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM\" height=\"992\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 2400w\" width=\"2000\"/><figcaption>GitHub's Home Page.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you might think that coding implies sitting at a desk for many hours looking at your code without any human interaction.

This is one of the most useful and powerful skills that you can learn and use to make your visions come true. In this handbook, we will dive into why programming is important, its applications, its basic concepts, and the skills you need to become a successful programmer. You will learn:What programming is and why it is important.What a programming language is and why it is important.How programming is related to binary numbers.Real-world applications of programming.Skills you need to succeed as a programmer.Tips for learning how to code.Basic programming concepts.Types of programming languages.How to contribute to open source projects.And more...Are you ready? Let's begin! \u2728 \u00a0Programming is essential for our everyday lives.Did you know that computer programming is already a fundamental part of your everyday lives? Let's see why. I'm sure that you will be greatly surprised. Every time you turn on your smartphone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, or any other electronic device, you are running code that was planned, developed, and written by developers. This code creates the final and interactive result that you can see on your screen.That is exactly what programming is all about. It is the process of writing code to solve a particular problem or to implement a particular task. Programming is what allows your computer to run the programs you use every day and your smartphone to run the apps that you love. It is an essential part of our world as we know it. Whenever you check your calendar, attend virtual conferences, browse the web, or edit a document, you are using code that has been written by developers. \"And what is code?\" you may ask.Code is a sequence of instructions that a programmer writes to tell a device (like a computer) what to do. The device cannot know by itself how to handle a particular situation or how to perform a task. So developers are in charge of analyzing the situation and writing explicit instructions to implement what is needed. To do this, they follow a particular syntax (a set of rules for writing the code).A developer (or programmer) is the person who analyzes a problem and implements a solution in code.Sounds amazing, right? It's very powerful and you can be part this wonderful world too by learning how to code. Let's see how.You, as a developer. Let's put you in a developer's shoes for a moment. Imagine that you are developing a mobile app, like the ones that you probably have installed on your smartphone right now. What is the first thing that you would do? Think about this for a moment.The answer is...Analyzing the problem. What are you trying to build?As a developer, you would start by designing the layout of the app, how it will work, its different screens and functionality, and all the small details that will make your app an awesome tool for users around the world. Only after you have everything carefully planned out, you can start to write your code. To do that, you will need to choose a programming language to work with. Let's see what a programming language is and why they are super important. \ud83d\udd38 What is a Programing Language?Logos of popular programming languages.A programming language is a language that computers can understand. We cannot just write English words in our program like this:\"Computer, solve this task!\"and hope that our computer can understand what we mean. We need to follow certain rules to write the instructions. Every programming language has its own set of rules that determine if a line of code is valid or not. Because of this, the code you write in one programming language will be slightly different from others. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: Some programming languages are more complex than others but most of them share core concepts and functionality. If you learn how to code in one programming language, you will likely be able to learn another one faster.Before you can start writing awesome programs and apps, you need to learn the basic rules of the programming language you chose for the task. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: a program is a set of instructions written in a programming language for the computer to execute. We usually write the code for our program in one or multiple files.For example, this is a line of code in Python (a very popular programming language) that shows the message \"Hello, World!\":print(\"Hello, World!\")But if we write the same line of code in JavaScript (a programming language mainly used for web development), we will get an error because it will not be valid.To do something very similar in JavaScript, we would write this line of code instead:console.log(\"Hello, World!\");Visually, they look very different, right? This is because Python and JavaScript have a different syntax and a different set of built-in functions.\ud83d\udca1 Tip: built-in functions are basically tasks that are already defined in the programming language. This lets us use them directly in our code by writing their names and by specifying the values they need. \u00a0In our examples, print() is a built-in function in Python while console.log() is a function that we can use in JavaScript to see the message in the console (an interactive tool) if we run our code in the browser. Examples of programming languages include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, C#, C++, PHP, Go, Swift, SQL, and R. There are many programming languages and most of them can be used for many different purposes. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: These were the most popular programming languages on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022:The 14 most popular programming languages among all respondents of the StackOverflow Developer Survey 2022. It's a yearly survey that collects information about popular technologies and trends in the developer community.There are many other programming languages (hundreds or even thousands!) but usually, you will learn and work with some of the most popular ones. Some of them have broader applications like Python and JavaScript while others (like R) have more specific (and even scientific) purposes. This sounds very interesting, right? And we are only starting to talk about programming languages. There is a lot to learn about them and I promise you that if you dive deeper into programming, your time and effort will be totally worth it. Awesome! Now that you know what programming is and what programming languages are all about, let's see how programming is related to binary numbers. \ud83d\udd39 Programming and Binary NumbersWhen you think about programming, perhaps the first thing that comes to your mind is something like the below image, right? A sequence of 0s and 1s on your computer. Binary numbers are 0 and 1.Programming is indeed related to binary numbers ( 0 and 1) but in an indirect way. Developers do not actually write their code using zeros and ones. We usually write programs in a high-level programming language, a programming language with a syntax that recognizes specific words (called keywords), symbols, and values of different data types. Basically, we write code in a way that humans can understand.For example, these are the keywords that we can use in Python:False               class               from                or\nNone                continue            global              pass\nTrue                def                 if                  raise\nand                 del                 import              return\nas                  elif                in                  try\nassert              else                is                  while\nasync               except              lambda              with\nawait               finally             nonlocal            yield\nbreak               for                 not List of Python keywords.Every programming language has its own set of keywords (words written in English). These keywords are part of the syntax and core functionality of the programming language. But keywords are just common words in English, almost like the ones that we would find in a book.That leads us to two very important questions:How does the computer understand and interpret what we are trying to say?Where does the binary number system come into play here?The computer does not understand these words, symbols, or values directly. When a program runs, the code that we write in a high-level programming language that humans can understand is automatically transformed into binary code that the computer can understand. Process of transforming a program into binary code.This transformation of source code that humans can understand into binary code that the computer can understand is called compilation. According to Britannica, a compiler is defined as:Computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer\u2019s CPU.Britannica also mentions that:The term compiler was coined by American computer scientist Grace Hopper, who designed one of the first compilers in the early 1950s.Some programming languages can be classified as compiled programming languages while others can be classified as interpreted programming languages based on how to they are transformed into machine-language instructions. However, they all have to go through a process that converts them into instructions that the computer can understand. Awesome. Now you know why binary code is so important for computer science. Without it, basically programming would not exist because computers would not be able to understand our instructions. Now let's dive into the applications of programming and the different areas that you can explore. \ud83d\udd38 Real-World Applications of ProgrammingProgramming has many real-world applications in basically every industry that you can imagine.\u00a0Programming has many different applications in many different industries.

Back-End Web DevelopmentBack-End Web Developers develop servers and databases to handle everything that runs behind the scenes to make more complex web applications work correctly.More complex and dynamic web applications that work with user data also require a server. This is a computer program that receives requests and sends appropriate responses. They also need a database, a collection of values stored in a structured way. Back-End Web Developers are in charge of developing the code for these servers. They decide how to handle the different requests, how to send appropriate resources, how to store the information, and basically how to make everything that runs behind the scenes work smoothly and efficiently. A real-world example of back-end web development is what happens when you create an account on freeCodeCamp and complete a challenge. Your information is stored on a database and you can access it later when you sign in with your email and password.A freeCodeCamp interactive challenge.This amazing interactive functionality was implemented by back-end web developers.\ud83d\udca1 Tip: Full-stack Web Developers are in charge of both Front-End and Back-End Web Development.

Let's see how you can apply your programming skills in these fields.MedicineProgramming is really everywhere. If you are interested in the field of medicine, learning how to code can be very helpful for you too. Even if you would like to focus on computer science and software development, you can apply your knowledge in both fields.Specialized developers are in charge of developing and writing the code that powers and controls the devices and machines that are used by modern medicine. Think about it...all these machines and devices are controlled by software and someone has to write that software. Medical records are also stored and tracked by specialized systems created by developers. That could be you if you decide to follow this path. Sounds exciting, right?According to the scientific article Application of Computer Techniques in Medicine:Major uses of computers in medicine include hospital information system, data analysis in medicine, medical imaging laboratory computing, computer assisted medical decision making, care of critically ill patients, computer assisted therapy and so on.PharmacologyProgramming and computer science can also be applied to develop new drugs in the field of pharmacology.A remarkable example of what you can achieve in this field by learning how to code is presented in this article by MIT News. It describes how an MIT senior, Kristy Carpenter, was using computer science in 2019 to develop \"new, more affordable drugs.\" Kristy mentions that:Artificial intelligence, which can help compute the combinations of compounds that would be better for a particular drug, can reduce trial-and-error time and ideally quicken the process of designing new medicines.Another example of a real-world application of programming in pharmacology is related to Python (yes, Python has many applications!). Among its success stories, we find that Python was selected by AstraZeneca to develop techniques and programs that can help scientists to discover new drugs faster and more efficiently. The documentation explains that:To save time and money on laboratory work, experimental chemists use computational models to narrow the field of good drug candidates, while also verifying that the candidates to be tested are not simple variations of each other's basic chemical structure.If you are interested in learning programming for medicine or health-related fields, this is a free course on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel on programming for healthcare imaging:PyTorch and Monai for AI Healthcare Imaging - Python Machine Learning CourseEducationProgramming can be used to create tools that help teachers and students to have a more productive and engaging learning experience. Teaching students to code also develops their problem-solving skills.Have you ever thought that programming could be helpful for education? Well, let me tell you that it is and it is very important. Why? Because the digital learning tools that students and teachers use nowadays are programmed by developers. Every time a student opens an educational app, browses an educational platform like freeCodeCamp, writes on a digital whiteboard, or attends a class through an online meeting platform, programming is making that possible. As a programmer or as a teacher who knows how to code, you can create the next great app that will enhance the learning experience of students around the world. Perhaps it will be a note-taking app, an online learning platform, a presentation app, an educational game, or any other app that could be helpful for students. The important thing is to create it with students in mind if your goal is to make something amazing that will create long-lasting memories. If you envision it, then you can create it with code. \u00a0Teachers can also teach their students how to code to develop their problem-solving skills and to teach them important skills for their future.\ud83d\udca1 Tip: if you are teaching students how to code, Scratch is a great programming language to teach the basics of programming. It is particularly focused on teaching children how to code in an interactive way.According to the official Scratch website:Scratch is the world\u2019s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations.If you are interested in learning how to code for educational purposes, these are courses that you may find helpful on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel:Scratch Tutorial for Beginners - Make a Flappy Bird GameComputational Thinking & Scratch - Intro to Computer Science - Harvard's CS50 (2018)Android Development for Beginners - Full CourseFlutter Course for Beginners \u2013 37-hour Cross Platform App Development TutorialLearn Unity - Beginner's Game Development TutorialMachine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and RoboticsMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are very popular nowadays because platforms can learn how users engage with their content in order to suggest them relevant information and products.Some of the most amazing fields that are directly related to programming are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. Let's see why. Artificial Intelligence is defined by Britannica as:The project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.Machine learning is a branch or a subset of the field of Artificial Intelligence in which systems can learn on their own based on data. The goal of this learning process is to predict the expected output. These models continuously learn how to \"think\" and how to analyze situations based on their previous training. The most commonly used programming languages in these fields are Python, C, C#, C++, and MATLAB. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning have amazing applications in various industries, such as:Image and object detection.Making predictions based on patterns.Text recognition.Recommendation engines (like when an online shopping platform shows you products that you may like or when YouTube shows you videos that you may like).Spam detection for emails.Fraud detection.Social media features like personalized feeds.Many more... there are literally millions of applications in virtually every industry.

For example, this is a course on algorithmic trading on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. The possibilities are endless. I hope that this section will give you a notion of why learning how to code is so important for your present and for your future. It will be a valuable skill to have in any field you choose. Awesome. Now let's dive into the soft skills that you need to become a successful programmer. \ud83d\udd39 Skills of a Successful ProgrammerAfter going through the diverse range of applications of programming, you must be curious to know what skills are needed to succeed in this field. CuriosityA programmer should be curious. Whether you are just starting to learn how to code or you already have 20 years of experience, coding projects will always present you with new challenges and learning opportunities. If you take these opportunities, you will continously improve your skills and succeed. EnthusiasmEnthusiasm is a key trait of a successful programmer but this applies in general to any field if you want to succeed. Enthusiasm will keep you happy and curious about what you are creating and learning. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you ever feel like you are not as enthusiastic as you used to be, it's time to find or learn something new that can light the spark in you again and fill you with hope and dreams.PatienceA programmer must be patient because transforming an initial idea into a working product can take time, effort, and many different steps. Patience will keep you focused on your final goal. \u00a0ResilienceProgramming can be challenging. That is true. But what defines you is not how many challenges you face, it's how you face them. If you thrive despite these challenges, you will become a better programmer and you could create something that could change the world. CreativityProgrammers must be creative because even though every programming language has a particular set of rules for writing the code, coding is like using LEGOs. You have the building-blocks but you need to decide what to create and how to create it. The process of writing the code requires creativity while following the established best practices.Problem-solving and AnalysisProgramming is basically analyzing and solving problems with code. Depending on your field of choice, those problems will be simpler or more complex but they will all require some level of problem-solving skills and a thorough analysis of the situation. Questions like:What should I build?How can I build it?What is the best way to build this?Are part of the everyday routine of a programmer.Ability to Focus for Long Periods of TimeWhen you are working on a coding project, you will need to focus on a task for long periods of time. From creating the design, to planning and writing the code, to testing the result, and to fixing bugs (issues with the code), you will dedicate many hours to a particular task. This is why it's essential to be able to focus and to keep your final goal in mind. Taking Detailed NotesThis skill is very important for programmers, particularly when you are learning how to code. Taking detailed notes can be help you to understand and remember the concepts and tools you learn. This also applies for experienced programmers, since being a programmer involves life-long learning. CommunicationInitially, you might think that programming is a solitary activity and imagine that a programmer spends hundreds of hours alone sitting on a desk. But the reality is that when you find your first job, you will see that communication is super important to coordinate tasks with other team members and to exchange ideas and feedback.Open to FeedbackIn programming, there is usually more than one way to implement the same functionality. Different alternatives may work similarly, but some may be easier to read or more efficient in terms of time or resource consumption. When you are learning how to code, you should always take constructive feedback as a tool for learning. Similarly, when you are working on a team, take your colleagues' feedback positively and always try to improve. Life-long LearningProgramming equals life-long learning. If you are interested in learning how to code, you must know that you will always need to be learning new things as new technologies emerge and existing technologies are updated. Think about it... that is great because there is always something interesting and new to learn!Open to Trying New ThingsFinally, an essential skill to be a successful programmer is to be open to trying new things. Step out of your comfort zone and be open to new technologies and products. In the technology industry, things evolve very quickly and adapting to change is essential. \ud83d\udd38 Tips for Learning How to CodeNow that you know more about programming, programming languages, and the skills you need to be a successful programmer, let's see some tips for learning how to code. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: these tips are based on my personal experience and opinions. Choose one programming language to learn first. When you are learning how to code, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the number of options and entry paths. My advice would be to focus on understanding the essential computer science concepts and one programming language first. Python and JavaScript are great options to start learning the fundamentals. Take detailed notes. Note-taking skills are essential to record and to analyze the topics you are learning. You can add custom comments and annotations to explain what you are learning. Practice constantly. You can only improve your problem-solving skills by practicing and by learning new techniques and tools. Try to practice every day. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: There is a challenge called the #100DaysOfCode challenge that you can join to practice every day. \u00a0Always try again. If you can't solve a problem on your first try, take a break and come back again and again until you solve it. That is the only way to learn. Learn from your mistakes and learn new approaches. Learn how to research and how to find answers. Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks usually have official documentations that explain their built-in elements and tools and how you can use them. This is a precious resource that you should definitely refer to. Browse Stack Overflow. This is an amazing platform. It is like an online encyclopedia of answers to common programming questions. You can find answers to existing questions and ask new questions to get help from the community. Set goals. Motivation is one of the most important factors for success. Setting goals is very important to keep you focused, motivated, and enthusiastic. Once you reach your goals, set new ones that you find challenging and exciting.Create projects. When you are learning how to code, applying your skills will help you to expand your knowledge and remember things better. Creating projects is the perfect way to practice and to create a portfolio that you can show to potential employers. \ud83d\udd39 Basic Programming ConceptsGreat. If reading this article has helped you confirm that you want to learn programming, let's take your first steps. These are some basic programming concepts that you should know:Variable: a variable is a name that we assign to a value in a computer program. When we define a variable, we assign a value to a name and we allocate a space in memory to store that value. The value of a variable can be updated during the program. Constant: a constant is similar to a variable. It stores a value but it cannot be modified. Once you assign a value to a constant, you cannot change it during the entire program. Conditional: a conditional is a programming structure that lets developers choose what the computer should do based on a condition. If the condition is True, something will happen but if the condition is False, something different can happen. Loop: a loop is a programming structure that let us run a code block (a sequence of instructions) multiple times. They are super helpful to avoid code repetition and to implement more complex functionality.Function: a function helps us to avoid code repetition and to reuse our code. It is like a code block to which we assign a name but it also has some special characteristics. We can write the name of the function to run that sequence of instructions without writing them again. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: Functions can communicate with main programs and main programs can communicate with functions through parameters, arguments, and return statements. Class: a class is used as a blueprint to define the characteristics and functionality of a type of object. Just like we have objects in our real world, we can represent objects in our programs.Bug: a bug is an error in the logic or implementation of a program that results in an unexpected or incorrect output. Debugging: debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in a program. IDE: this acronym stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software development environment that has the most helpful tools that you will need to write computer programs such as a file editor, an explorer, a terminal, and helpful menu options. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: a commonly used and free IDE is Visual Studio Code, created by Microsoft. Awesome! Now you know some of the fundamental concepts in programming. Like you learned, each programming language has a different syntax, but they all share most of these programming structures and concepts. \u00a0\ud83d\udd38 Types of Programming LanguagesProgramming languages can be classified based on different criteria. If you want to learn how to code, it's important for you to learn these basic classifications:ComplexityHigh-level programming languages: they are designed to be understood by humans and they have to be converted into machine code before the computer can understand them. They are the programming languages that we commonly use. For example: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, and Kotlin.Low-level programming languages: they are more difficult to understand because they are not designed for humans. They are designed to be understood and processed efficiently by machines.Conversion into Machine CodeCompiled programming languages: programs written with this type of programming language are converted directly into machine code by a compiler. Examples include C, C++, Haskell, and Go. Interpreted programming languages: programs written with this type of programming language rely on another program called the interpreter, which is in charge of running the code line by line. Examples include Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby. \ud83d\udca1 Tip: according to this article on freeCodeCamp's publication:Most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations \u2013 the language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted. However, for simplicity\u2019s sake, they\u2019re typically referred to as such.There are other types of programming languages based on different criteria, such as:Procedural programming languagesFunctional programming languagesObject-oriented programming languagesScripting languagesLogic programming languagesAnd the list of types of programming languages continues. This is very interesting because you can analyze the characteristics of a programming language to help you choose the right one for your project. \ud83d\udd39 How to Contribute to Open Source ProjectsGitHub's Home Page.Finally, you might think that coding implies sitting at a desk for many hours looking at your code without any human interaction. But let me tell you that this does not have to be true at all. You can be part of a learning community or a developer community.Initially, when you are learning how to code, you can participate in a learning community like freeCodeCamp.
