Fortunately there are many programming tools available to developers who want to create them. Among these tools there is Flutter, which has distinguished itself lately. </p><p>Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).</p><p>Flutter consists of two important parts:</p><ul><li>An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).</li><li>A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.</li></ul><p>To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.</p><p>Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.</p><p>If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.</p><blockquote>\u201cFlutter is Google\u2019s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.\u201d - Google, <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">flutter.dev</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"why-you-should-learn-flutter\">Why you should learn Flutter?</h2><p>I selected some of the reasons why I like Flutter and why I want to use it next year.
