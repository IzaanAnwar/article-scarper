If someone asks you whether you understand something, try revealing that you may have gaps in your understanding [<a href=\"https://github.com/klcantrell/blog-content/blob/72b4a4eb94f8f10d935be724b7836e332942cf44/3-lessons-learned-in-my-first-months-as-a-nontraditional-software-engineer/31-experiences.md#11-team-members-constantly-check-if-i-understand-and-when-they-do-ive-erred-on-the-side-of-being-open-to-a-teaching-moment-rather-than-trying-to-prove-what-i-know-ive-noticed-that-the-team-jumps-on-the-opportunity-to-help-me-learn-this-attitude-is-well-described-by-the-expose-your-ignorance-pattern-in-the-book-apprenticeship-patterns\" rel=\"noopener\">11</a>].
