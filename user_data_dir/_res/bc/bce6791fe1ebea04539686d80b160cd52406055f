The different types of computer programs include Word processors, Database systems, video games, and websites.</p><p>These computer programs allow us to interactive with different software devices and services like phones, websites, and the computers themselves. </p><h2 id=\"history-of-programming\">History of Programming</h2><p>Many historians believe Ada Lovelace was the first to create a published computer program in the mid 19th century. She was a mathematician who translated Luigi Federico Menabrea's writings on the Analytical Engine.</p><p>In this translation, Ada had added her own extensive notes and created a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers for<strong> </strong>the Analytical Engine. </p><p>The work of mathematician Alonzo Church as well as the Turing machine were the first introductions of computer codes. </p><p>In the 1920's, computers were created which was followed by the earliest programming languages. For the next century, as machines and technology continued to evolve, so did the number of programming languages. </p><h2 id=\"types-of-programming-languages\">Types of programming languages</h2><p>There are hundreds of programming languages in existence. Developers will first consider the needs of the application so they can decide which languages would be appropriate to use. </p><p>Here are a few popular programming languages. \u00a0</p><ul><li>Python</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>C/C++</li><li>Java</li><li>C#</li><li>Ruby</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p>Some of these languages are primarily used in one field of development while others are more general purpose programming languages. </p><p>JavaScript is primarily used in web development and is usually the first programming language learned by beginner web developers. JavaScript can also be used for mobile and game development. </p><p>Python can be used in a variety of areas like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.</p><p>Programming languages are \u00a0grouped in a variety of categories. Here is a list of some of the categories. </p><ul><li>Machine language \u2013 a low level language that consist of 0's and 1's (binary). High level languages are compiled into machine code so the code can be executed by the computer. </li><li>Assembly language \u2013 a low level language that is compiled by an assembler.
