Is it to find a job, to automate your work, for a promotion, or for fun \u2013 or some combination? Your why should be the first factor to consider when selecting a language because that will serve as motivation to push through when the learning gets difficult. </p><p>Your why will also help narrow down the programming language options you have. For instance, if you\u2019re learning programming to perform better data analysis, then Python should be your go-to. But if your goal is to build for the web, you should learn JavaScript. Or if you\u2019re looking to build native iOS applications, then SwiftUI is your best bet \u2013 and so on. </p></div><p>Your why could also be to make a transition and secure a job in a particular industry or company. In such cases, you may want to engage recruiters, senior developers, mentors and current employees.

That is assuming you're focused and put in the needed effort towards your studies. \u00a0</p><p>Before picking which language to learn, you'll need to identify your time frame. How long can you dedicate to working and waiting to ensure your dream of learning to code becomes reality? This can be a helpful guide to finding and focusing on languages that are known to be relatively easier to learn if you have limited time, and vice versa. </p><p>This is especially true for people who have important life deadlines such as securing a job, getting a promotion, or finishing a project by a given date. </p><p>It's always best to dedicate as much time as possible to your studies to avoid putting yourself under unnecessary pressure. And if there's no time limitation and nothing at stake, you may want to explore more complex object-oriented languages.</p><h3 id=\"know-a-language-s-potential-the-what-\">Know a Language's Potential (The What)</h3><p>The potential of a language is also an important deciding factor. Potential here refers to the job and freelance opportunities that will be available to you after you learn a particular programming language. It also measures how much employers require that language. </p><p>Learning to code in an in-demand programming language means that you become an in-demand developer, which gives you a lot of leverage and opportunities to make money (both by yourself or in a company).
