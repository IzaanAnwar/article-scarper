Well, let me explain.What are Naming Conventions in Programming?Apart from the hard and fast rules that we get with every programming language, there are also conventions. These are sets of standards that are generally accepted by the majority of developers out there.Among all sorts of conventions, naming conventions are some of the most common. Because as programmers, we name a lot of things. Such as variables, functions, classes, methods, interfaces and so on.Throughout the years, developers have used different case types to name different entities in their code. And four of them have proved to be the most popular ones. They are:Camel CaseSnake CaseKebab CasePascal CaseLet's have a look at some examples so you can see how these work, shall we?What is Camel Case?In camel case, you start a name with a small letter. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with a capital letter: Here are some examples of camel case: firstName and lastName.What is Snake Case?Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words. Here are some examples of snake case: first_name and last_name.What is Kebab Case?Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (_) to separate the words.Here are some examples of kebab case: first-name and last-name.What is Pascal Case?Unlike the previous examples, names in pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.Here are some examples of pascal case: FirstName and LastName.When to Use Each Naming ConventionNow, based on the language you're working on and what you're naming, the preferred case type can change. For example, according to the PEP 8 \u2013 Style Guide for Python Code, variable and function names should use snake case:user_name = 'Farhan'\n\ndef reverse_name(name):\n\treturn name[::-1]Let's take a look at JavaScript now.
