I have been working as a mobile app developer for the past year and a half, after graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science. As of a couple of months ago, I have been fired (insert dramatic music). The reason: downsizing and making the company leaner. Without giving away too much, I wasn\u2019t the only one fired from my team, and the company\u2019s workforce decreased by about 40%. Yup, that much.</p><p>As fresh graduates know, <strong>there is a vicious cycle (at least in my country of residence), when trying to get a job in this industry</strong>.

That may sound funny, but in reality,<strong> IT IS HARD</strong>. After you revise your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and update it accordingly, you are faced with searching online for your next position. Due to my situation, I did not have the luxury of time, since no job = no money ?.</p><p>The times have changed, and no one looks for jobs in the classified ads anymore. Your number one source for jobs is your friends. Ask around, see if they can refer you to one of their friends. Most companies prefer interviewing someone that\u2019s recommended from a current employee instead of sifting through hundreds of applicants and choosing several. Look at LinkedIn, groups on Facebook, or Glassdoor for any job listings.</p><p>After those first few days of shock due to my untimely departure from being a mobile developer passed, I developed a routine. Wake up in the morning, review mails, look for new job postings in various sources, prepare for coming interviews, follow through home assignments that were part of interview processes, sharpen my skills by solving coding problems, and maintain an active Github/Codepen account.</p><p>Routine gives you structure and moves you along through the things you need to focus on. There is a lot to handle, and time is of the essence.</p><figure><img alt=\"UZogOaLggiDyp4ZOqeqNqOQa2qIHzaoEKc0e\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/UZogOaLggiDyp4ZOqeqNqOQa2qIHzaoEKc0e\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>Time sure flies by when you don\u2019t have a job</figcaption></figure><p>Before you start interviewing, refresh your memory on subjects you know are rusty to you. Go over sorting algorithms and try to implement them.

Once you can grasp the very fundamental principles of a subject, <strong>there is no defeating you</strong>. No matter what question gets thrown at you.</p><p>After you feel sufficiently versed, try your hand in different coding exercises in any coding language. <a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Codewars</a>, <a href=\"https://www.codility.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Codility</a>, <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Euler</a> and <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">LeetCode</a> are just a few examples of places to sharpen your skills.</p><p>Searching for popular interview questions is also a must, since most interview questions tend to test the same design patterns/logic of a candidate.</p><p>While studying for job interviews, I took part in numerous online courses. I also made sure to create <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Codepen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Github</a> accounts to showcase projects I was making. I won\u2019t go into detail about what courses I took or where to look, since that\u2019s been covered far and wide. But having those profiles present on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 improved my chances of getting that first phone call. Why? Because by going to those profiles, interviewers could see my coding style upfront. They could see that I am a self learner, and that in my spare time, I code.</p><h3 id=\"the-interviewing-process\">The Interviewing Process</h3><p>There are no two equal interview processes, and no two companies are alike. While this can be an advantage, it can also be frustrating. Since each company has varying degrees and lengths of processes, it can take between weeks to even months (yeah, not joking) for an interview process to move along. This can come from a plethora of reasons ranging from the urgency of the position they want filled, company culture, number of candidates and so on. What you need to remember is to <strong>hold on</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=\"5TmarRDofdw56zKBiZui5tl0JMns0UPIMZqi\" height=\"532\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/5TmarRDofdw56zKBiZui5tl0JMns0UPIMZqi\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/6SNbWyFwuhk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">nikko macaspac</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Seriously, I know it sounds simple, but it is really important.

Try not to read too much into it if the interview gets cancelled at midnight the day before (it happens). If a company takes too long to reply to you, send an email.

Yes, you are an individual, just like every other person that applied for that position. But, if a company and its employees take that little extra step, it really does make a huge difference.</p><h3 id=\"some-words-of-advice\">Some Words Of Advice</h3><p>At the very beginning, and depending on which positions you are seeking, it may seem wise to decline interviews at companies that don\u2019t seem interesting to you. And that may be so, but there are several good reasons not to do so:</p><ol><li>Even though going to interviews is time consuming, you learn from each interview. So going to one at a company that may not interest you will still give you the chance to experience what an interview feels like and gage your skills accordingly. Not to mention the variety of technical questions you will encounter.</li><li>Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. If the job\u2019s description over the phone doesn\u2019t seem that intriguing, it doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t anything that might still interest you. Maybe the company is moving in a new direction and is getting ready to change its technologies. Maybe your direct team leader will be someone that you are willing to work with, no matter what you\u2019ll be doing. You never know, and until you try, you just won\u2019t. Additionally, connections are a huge part of this industry. You will be meeting different people with different backgrounds, and even if you don\u2019t pass an interview step, you still might impress someone who will suggest you to a colleague or friend.</li><li>Like I mentioned earlier, there are no two interview processes that are alike. But getting familiar with as many as you can will only benefit you. For example, while I was interviewing for several companies, I had my heart set on company A. As part of the interviewing process, I knew that I had to interview in front of two personnel at the same time, whiteboard and all. At company B, that kind of interview also existed, so I made sure to go to the interview for company B, before going to company A. I did this so I could gain the experience of what it felt like and to see how I fared. That way, I could show up for company A more prepared and most importantly, more confident.</li></ol><figure><img alt=\"6GJr5fNps1jxM0O9KcgKmugVK6UYBowmsdk4\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/6GJr5fNps1jxM0O9KcgKmugVK6UYBowmsdk4\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>Yeah, that\u2019s me. Enjoying nature at its best</figcaption></figure><p>As a final note, it is important to remember not to get sucked under while going through this ordeal. Some interviews will be good, others, not so much.</p><p><strong>Learn from your mistakes and remember to take a break from it all</strong>. I mean it. Take a day off and do something to relax. Something to revitalize your soul. Go hiking, watch a movie, go see a concert.
