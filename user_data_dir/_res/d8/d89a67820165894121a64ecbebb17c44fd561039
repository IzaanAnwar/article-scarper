That way, your code will remain readable, easy to understand, and maintainable for yourself and other developers you may be working with on a team.\nLet's see each case in more detail in the following sections.\nWhat is Snake Case? \nSnake case separates each word with an underscore character (_).\nWhen using snake case, all letters need to be lowercase.\nHere are some examples of how you would use the snake case:\nnumber_of_donuts = 34\n\nfave_phrase = \"Hello World\"\n\nSnake case is used for creating variable and method names.\nSnake case is also a good choice for naming files, as it keeps names readable.\nYou will typically encounter it the most when programming in Python and not so much when programming in Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript.\nYou will also come across it when working with databases, as it is used for creating table and column names.\nThere is also an all-caps version of the snake case where all letters are in the upper case - also known as the screaming snake case.\nHere are some examples of how you would use upper case snake case:\nNUMBER_OF_DONUTS = 34\n\nFAVE_PHRASE = \"Hello World\"\n\nThe capitalized version is used for declaring constants in most programming languages. A constant is a data item whose value doesn't change throughout the life of a program.\nWhat is Kebab Case? \nThe kebab case is very similar to snake case.\nThe difference between snake case and kebab case is that kebab case separates each word with a dash character, -, instead of an underscore.\nSo, all words are lowercase, and each word gets separated by a dash.\nThe kebab case is another one of the most human-readable ways of combining multiple words into a single word.\nHere are some examples of how you would use kebab case:\nnumber-of-donuts = 34\n\nfave-phrase = \"Hello World\"\n\nYou will encounter kebab cases mostly in URLs.\nA URL (short for Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique address for accessing a resource on the Web.\nWhat is Camel Case? \nWhen using camel case, you start by making the first word lowercase. Then, you capitalize the first letter of each word that follows.\nSo, a capital letter appears at the start of the second word and at each new subsequent word that follows it.\nHere are some examples of how you would use camel case:\nnumberOfDonuts = 34\n\nfavePhrase = \"Hello World\"\n\nIn the example numberOfDonuts, the first word number is lowercase. Then,  the first letter of the second word, Of, is capitalized, as is the first letter of the third word, Donuts.\nYou will encounter camel case in Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript for creating variable, function, and method names.\nWhat is Pascal Case? \nPascal case is similar to camel case.\nThe only difference between the two is that pascal case requires the first letter of the first word to also be capitalized.\nSo, when using pascal case, every word starts with an uppercase letter (in contrast to camel case, where the first word is in lowercase).\nHere are some examples of how you would use pascal case:\nNumberOfDonuts = 34\n\nFavePhrase = \"Hello World\"\n\nYou will see the pascal case used for naming classes in most programming languages.\nConclusion\nHopefully, this article helped you understand the differences between the types of casings in programming and where you will most likely encounter each one.\nThank you for reading, and happy coding!\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n                        \n\n\n        Learn to code for free. freeCodeCamp's open source curriculum has helped more than 40,000 people get jobs as developers.
