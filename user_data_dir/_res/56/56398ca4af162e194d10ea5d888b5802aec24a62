Unfortunately, there is a global stereotype and fallacy that you have to have a permanent job till the end of your life. But who said this is the way things should be? You are a mature person who knows what you are looking for and what outcome you want to get. That is why, once you have decided that you want to code \u2014 develop this spark, and, sooner or later, it will pay you off.</p><p>Another motivation is to think about yourself and never compare to somebody else since people have different experiences and different levels of knowledge. The starting point should be what you knew before you started learning. You\u2019ll be surprised comparing your progress with the previous stage.</p><p>There is a wonderful example of a coder from my course who had never had a job related to a technical occupation. But he decided to pass step-by-step tutorials on CodeGym, and you know what? He succeeded and got the job he wanted.</p><p>And never be afraid of \u201cbad code\u201d or lack of experience since whatever age you are everyone makes mistakes at the beginning and they disappear gradually while you hone your skills. You know that younger students worry as much as the older ones? Will I get a job with no experience? But, the truth is, some companies are looking for people with minimal experience to grow a specialist for their projects. Besides, technologies are developing every day and they will require lots of code and those who can create it. You can\u2019t learn everything in one go :)</p><h3 id=\"reason-4-learning-java-is-like-learning-any-other-skill\">Reason 4. Learning Java is like learning any other skill</h3><p>Learning Java is no different than, let\u2019s say, learning to ride a bike. There is no big difference. However, if you start learning to ride a bike at a mature age, you\u2019ll worry more, and yet it\u2019s more likely that you will spend less time on it. Age plays a significant role in your wisdom and experience since you make mistakes and know how to fix them.</p><p>Programming is not only coding itself, but searching for the best solution to an issue people have faced. And here, your experience will help greatly. Thus, having the background in another field is a huge advantage. And many who did the same steps admit that their maturity increased their success.</p><h3 id=\"reason-5-now-is-as-good-of-a-time-as-any\">Reason 5. Now is as good of a time as any</h3><p>Never postpone what you plan, start learning as soon as possible, since the right time never comes. All you\u2019ll do is waste your valuable time if you wait. Besides, later in life, you\u2019ll have even more doubts than you have now, and it will be more difficult to start.</p><p>In addition, you\u2019ll have new opportunities to change your job or even to get a promotion or improve your current work. Isn\u2019t it appealing? It\u2019s easy to find on Reddit a story of a person in his mid 30s with a thorny path through working with young coders and the corporate structure inside the companies he faced. But it made him stronger and he got the job even easier than he thought.</p><h3 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up</h3><p>If you are one of those who are at a crossroads, thinking \u201cI\u2019m too old for x,\u201d you should know that age is just time exposure, that helps you to see what youngsters usually don\u2019t. Learning something new will keep your mental health in order, and your mental acuity will be equal to those younger than you.</p><p>Therefore, choosing the way to learn Java at home/online is just another perfect opportunity to show everyone that you can do more.
