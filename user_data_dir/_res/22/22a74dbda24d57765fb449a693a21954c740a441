Let\u2019s start with an example of a post from NASA. The post can be broken down into a few vital components: an image, description, and hashtags.</p><figure><img alt=\"22w7-FHEtT7b8VUmP6o0k0S4uDQ7-pHsBcUf\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/22w7-FHEtT7b8VUmP6o0k0S4uDQ7-pHsBcUf\" width=\"600\"/><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwH0GRAjL5i/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwH0GRAjL5i/</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"what-does-this-have-to-do-with-code\">What does this have to do with code?</h3><p>I\u2019m getting there! Looking at each part, we can start to relate these back to our merge request. Starting with the 3 basics:</p><ul><li>Image =&gt; Code</li><li>Description =&gt; What is your feature?</li><li>Hashtags =&gt; What parts of your application does this impact?</li></ul><h4 id=\"code\">Code</h4><p>Just as much as the image or video is the most important aspect of a post, so is your code. It\u2019s the primary content that\u2019s driving the conversation and interest. While it\u2019s strong on its own, without context it can create its own set of issues.</p><h4 id=\"description\">Description</h4><p>In NASA\u2019s post above, without seeing the description, this could very well be a blurry illustration of the Death Star. Instead, thanks to the description, we find out it\u2019s Jupiter. The infrared imaging allows us to get a better look at its atmosphere.</p><figure><img alt=\"2jgyZaOM9IPXhInSF6AoSEMBTofSb0CydA7L\" height=\"421\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/2jgyZaOM9IPXhInSF6AoSEMBTofSb0CydA7L\" width=\"750\"/><figcaption><em>That\u2019s no moon! Right, it\u2019s Jupiter.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Not knowing what the code you\u2019re looking at does or what it impacts can lead to confusion and a lack of understanding for those not already familiar with your application. Even for veterans, only being able to see a small segment of a diff when compared to a giant codebase completely changes what you\u2019re looking at.</p><h4 id=\"areas-of-impact\">Areas of Impact</h4><p>Just as hashtags allow people to tag content to show the topics it\u2019s related to, providing an area of impact helps give your reviewer an idea of where they should be paying attention. If the reviewer or tester only knows of one location a changed component is used (when it\u2019s used more broadly throughout the application), they\u2019re potentially missing important use cases that may have breaking changes outside of that instance.</p><h3 id=\"learning-from-history\">Learning from History</h3><p>I\u2019m sure Jupiter will stick around for the next 2 years. Looking back at our code within that amount of time can feel like a completely different landscape. Bits of code that were worked on by developers long gone may not be completely understood. It could be crucial to the integrity of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"TK-wVHMdMdlwkREfBQumX1K6H3f7CG-Rocs1\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/TK-wVHMdMdlwkREfBQumX1K6H3f7CG-Rocs1\" width=\"600\"/><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BveREmPD9Vb/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em>https://www.instagram.com/p/BveREmPD9Vb/</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Each of these merge request components plays a key role in preventing lost knowledge and context of changes to an application.
