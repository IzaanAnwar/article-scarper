You can use the library anytime after you link it.</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- This is html --&gt;</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;script src=\"link-to-jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;script&gt;  // You can use jQuery anytime after you link to it  console.log(jQuery)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p>This works because JavaScript in browsers shares one global scope. It doesn\u2019t matter how many JavaScript files you link to. They behave as if they\u2019re one big JavaScript file.</p><p>With this information, we can begin writing a library for use in the frontend world.</p><p>Let\u2019s say you want to create a library called <code>peachBlossom</code>. <code>peachBlossom</code> has a <code>bloom</code> function. You write this <code>bloom</code> function in a separate JavaScript file, <code>peach-blossom.js</code>.</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>// peach-blossom.jsfunction bloom () {  console.log('Bloom!')}</code></pre><p>You can include <code>peachBlossom</code> in your frontend JavaScript by linking to the <code>peach-blossom.js</code> file.

This is because Node doesn\u2019t have HTML files and <code>&lt;scri</code>pt&gt; tags.</p><p>Let\u2019s make sure you know how to run Node before we begin writing a library for Node.</p><h4 id=\"running-node\">Running Node</h4><p>First, you need to make sure you have Node installed on your computer. You can install Node from <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener\">Node\u2019s website</a> if you don\u2019t have it installed already.</p><p>Once you have Node installed, you\u2019ll want to create a folder to store your Node project. In this case, let\u2019s call it \u201cnode-project\u201d.</p><p>The command to create a folder is this:</p><pre><code># This is bash</code></pre><pre><code>mkdir node-project</code></pre><p>Then, you need to navigate to the <code>node-project</code> directory. You can do it with <code>cd</code>:</p><pre><code># This is bashcd node-project</code></pre><p>If you\u2019re having problems with the command line, you can use <a href=\"https://zellwk.com/blog/fear-of-command-line/\" rel=\"noopener\">this guide</a> to help you out.</p><p>Next, we want to create a file. This will be a JavaScript file. (We will run Node on this file). Let\u2019s call it <code>index.js</code>.</p><pre><code># This is bash</code></pre><pre><code>touch index.js</code></pre><figure><img alt=\"f0BgtmtrZh4oc2U58UuNiCxOVxx-ibcLd4nE\" height=\"72\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/f0BgtmtrZh4oc2U58UuNiCxOVxx-ibcLd4nE\" width=\"650\"/></figure><p>In <code>index.js</code>, we\u2019re going to write a <code>console.log</code> statement. This is for us to know if we run the file.</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>// index.jsconsole.log('Running index.js!')</code></pre><p>Finally, you can use <code>node</code> to run <code>index.js</code>. Here\u2019s the command:</p><pre><code># This is bash</code></pre><pre><code>node index.js</code></pre><p>Once you run <code>index.js</code>, you should see the <code>console.log</code> in the terminal. That\u2019s how we know the file has run.</p><figure><img alt=\"b-KuiWqcDHmAGXKBJ6uVsJPwU6bdeRYTCow9\" height=\"106\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/b-KuiWqcDHmAGXKBJ6uVsJPwU6bdeRYTCow9\" width=\"740\"/></figure><h4 id=\"adding-libraries-to-node\">Adding libraries to Node</h4><p>To add libraries to Node, you have to use the <code>require</code> statement. Once you add a library, you can use the library anywhere in the same JavaScript file.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example:</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>const fs = require('fs')console.log(fs)</code></pre><figure><img alt=\"tuH9M9aEGONU-7bU7OlXhK4knqSm0h7WLmN3\" height=\"206\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/tuH9M9aEGONU-7bU7OlXhK4knqSm0h7WLmN3\" width=\"800\"/></figure><p>When you use <code>require</code>, Node looks for the library you specified in three places:</p><p>First, it checks whether the library is built into Node. In this example, <code>fs</code> is built directly into Node. You can use <code>fs</code> anytime if you use Node.</p><p>Second, it checks whether the library exists in the <code>node_modules</code> folder. These are user-installed libraries. You can add a library to the <code>node_modules</code> folder by running <code>npm install</code>.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example where we install <code>express</code>, then require express in Node:</p><pre><code># This is bash</code></pre><pre><code># Run this in the command linenpm install express</code></pre><pre><code>// This is js </code></pre><pre><code>// Index.js const express = require('express')console.log(express)</code></pre><figure><img alt=\"bcyHIXmeoXF45Sr4heQfBSnhFRiTMscQ1iIr\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/bcyHIXmeoXF45Sr4heQfBSnhFRiTMscQ1iIr\" width=\"800\"/></figure><p>Third, if you add <code>./</code> to <code>require</code>, Node will look for a file located in the current directory. This is where we can begin writing the <code>peach-blossom</code> library.</p><h4 id=\"writing-your-first-library-for-node\">Writing your first library for Node</h4><p>Let\u2019s start by creating a <code>peach-blossom.js</code> file. This file should be in the same directory as <code>index.js</code>.</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>touch peach-blossom.js</code></pre><figure><img alt=\"vHap18-jDq8MyfYna0XkLMbHFqeVF7EPQmXP\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/vHap18-jDq8MyfYna0XkLMbHFqeVF7EPQmXP\" width=\"778\"/></figure><p>We can add <code>peach-blossom.js</code> to <code>index.js</code> by using <code>require</code>. Here\u2019s what it looks like:</p><pre><code>// This is js </code></pre><pre><code>const peachBlossom = require('./peach-blossom')</code></pre><p>In Node, there\u2019s no concept of a shared global scope. Each file has its own scope. So, if you write <code>peach-blossom.js</code> as if it\u2019s used for frontend JavaScript, you won\u2019t be able to use it. You\u2019ll get an error.</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>// peach-blossom.js const peachBlossom = (function () { // Write as much code as you want here</code></pre><pre><code>// Return what others can use return { bloom: function () { console.log(\u2018Bloom!\u2019) } }})()</code></pre><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>// index.js const peachBlossom = require(\u2018./peach-blossom\u2019)</code></pre><figure><img alt=\"DeVVpx8tTDzGn56qpevFYrfJnDX1RzQTIBcy\" height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/DeVVpx8tTDzGn56qpevFYrfJnDX1RzQTIBcy\" width=\"800\"/></figure><p>To pass variables from one file to another in Node, you have to write <code>module.exports</code>. Variables passed to <code>module.exports</code> can be retrieved from another file.</p><p>This means we must write <code>module.exports</code> in <code>peach-blossom.js</code>.</p><pre><code>// This is js </code></pre><pre><code>// Write as much code as you want here const peachBlossom = { bloom () { console.log(\u2018Bloom!\u2019) }}</code></pre><pre><code>// Exports peachBlossom for use in other filesmodule.exports = peachBlossom</code></pre><p>Once we have exported <code>peachBlossom</code>, we can use it in other files:</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>// index.js const peachBlossom = require('./peach-blossom')peachBlossom.bloom() // Bloom!```</code></pre><p>This format of passing variables around in Node with <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code> is called <strong>CommonJS</strong>.</p><h4 id=\"publishing-your-library-as-an-npm-package\">Publishing your library as an npm package</h4><p>In short, to make your module work in Node, you have to export a variable with <code>module.exports</code>. Other people can then <code>require</code> this module in their code.</p><p>At this point, you can move <code>peach-blossom</code> into a separate project folder and publish it as an npm package. You can use <a href=\"https://zellwk.com/blog/publish-to-npm/\" rel=\"noopener\">this guide</a> to find out more about publishing the process.</p><h3 id=\"writing-modules-that-are-usable-in-both-frontend-and-backend-javascript\">Writing modules that are usable in both frontend and backend JavaScript</h3><p>Let\u2019s take a moment to reconcile what we know.</p><p>To write a library for the frontend, we need to declare it as a variable. As much as possible, we want to expose one variable only.</p><pre><code>// This is js</code></pre><pre><code>const peachBlossom = (function () {  // Write as much code as you want here</code></pre><pre><code>// Return what others can use  return {    bloom: function () {      console.log('Bloom!')    }  }})()</code></pre><p>To write a library for the Node, we need to export the variable with <code>module.exports</code>.
