Though the titles themselves don\u2019t inherently have a difference in the work at hand, it will affect how much you get paid, time-off, benefits, and overall job security. Before you begin your search and negotiating your salary, write down the things that you\u2019ll need to take into consideration:</p><ul><li>Do you have any big vacations in the near future?</li><li>How often do you need your paycheck?</li><li>How much do you spend each month? Personal? Bills? Other responsibilities?</li><li>Are you planning on moving anytime soon?</li></ul><p>Some individuals wish for a full-time position with a certain organization (full benefits, PTO, and holidays off), but you may have to work as a contractor there before the employer is willing to hire you full-time. Research the market in your area while you are networking. You might be financially flexible now but require more stability in a few years, you never know.</p><p><em>Also\u2026 important tidbit.</em></p><p><em>Wherever you land, the likelihood of you being there for more than 3 years is very low. <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/software-had-the-highest-job-turnover-rate-of-any-industry-in-2017/\" rel=\"noopener\">In 2017, the Software Engineering industry had the highest turnover of any other industry, and for good reason</a>. Between the demand and the rising compensation to entice talented engineers, the cost of your time will significantly increase the more you work. Take this into consideration as you look forward to accepting your first position; you probably won\u2019t be there forever, so what are some compromises you can make for a year or two?</em></p><ul><li>\u201cContract vs. Full-time\u201d \u2014 <a href=\"https://blog.toggl.com/contract-vs-full-time/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.toggl.com/contract-vs-full-time/</a></li></ul><h4 id=\"6-your-worth-what-you-ll-be-paid\"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Your worth != what you\u2019ll be paid</strong></h4><p>One of the most difficult pieces of advice for me to accept was the reality that the salary I am offered will not directly equal my worth as a professional.</p><p>Hypothetically, let\u2019s say I am great candidate for an entry-level position. I\u2019m hard-working, eager, and willing to learn and I\u2019m worth a specific amount in the workforce. Though this is very logical thinking, it isn\u2019t necessarily how businesses think when it comes to salary negotiation. Despite their eagerness to get talented developers, they are still in the business of making a profit. Which can mean offering a lower salary to someone who\u2019s willing to accept it.</p><p>You might need to view your potential salary as \u201chow much will get me motivated to go to work in the morning\u201d versus \u201chow much am I \u2018worth\u2019\u201d. This change in mindset can save your self-esteem and stress-level as you begin salary negotiations. The likelihood of them aiming lower than you think you\u2019re \u2018worth\u2019 is high. As long as there are individuals willing to accept a lower salary, you will have a hard time finding someone who\u2019s willing to pay you what you think you are worth.</p><p>Though this might be frustrating at first, understand that the number it takes you to \u201cget up in the morning\u201d will increase over time. You won\u2019t be at the low end of the pay scale forever. The more experience you have, the more power you will have in negotiating your salary. Rest assured that there are plenty of ways to climb in the technology industry.</p><ul><li>Glassdoor \u201cEntry Level Developer\u201d Salary Estimate \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/entry-level-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/entry-level-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htm</a></li><li>Glassdoor \u201cKnow your worth\u201d Personal Estimate \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/know-your-worth.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/know-your-worth.htm</a></li></ul><h4 id=\"7-get-familiar-with-testing-and-testing-frameworks\"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Get familiar with testing and testing frameworks</strong></h4><p>Though it\u2019s rarely covered in an undergraduate degree, software testing is something that you will encounter in almost every development job.</p><p>As an engineer, your job is to develop great solutions alongside ensuring those solutions don\u2019t break previous functionality. Through utilizing testing frameworks, developers are able to identify when bugs produced in newly produced code.</p><p>By addressing these issues early on, you can eliminate a large portion of the bugs a client may find through regular interaction with the product. Though you can never truly eliminate all bugs, you can take responsibility for the product by using testing best-practices.</p><p>Testing can help you become a better developer. As Boris Beizer, an American software engineer and author, once said\u2026</p><blockquote><em>\u201cMore than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded \u2014 indeed, test-design thinking can discover and eliminate bugs at every stage in the creation of software, from conception to specification, to design, coding and the rest.\u201d</em></blockquote><ul><li>\u201cWhat is Software Testing?

They have made it their business to produce young, talented professionals who are ready for the workforce. Don\u2019t be shocked that businesses reach out to them on a regular basis asking for candidates. You will only discover these opportunities if you take the time to talk with them and ask!</p><p>I graduated from a small, private university and even there I had an impressive amount of resources to aid me in securing my first job. Between resume reviewers, local company contacts, and even exclusive job opportunity postings, Universities have a wealth of resources. Let\u2019s not forget about job fairs that are constantly happening throughout the city! Take the time and investigate the resources available. You might be pleasantly surprised at the help they provide.</p><h4 id=\"9-interview-often\"><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Interview often</strong></h4><p>Oftentimes, we put an extreme amount of pressure on ourselves during a job search. If you\u2019re anything like me, interviews are anxiety producing, nerve-wracking, and an overall unpleasant experience. However, all of this is simply because of inexperience in the actual act of interviewing itself. If you\u2019re not comfortable in who you\u2019re speaking with and knowledgeable of what exactly they\u2019re looking for, you are going to be nervous! What\u2019s the best way to combat interview anxiety? \u2026 More interviews.</p><p>Throughout your career you are going to work in numerous places so it will benefit you to become a \u201cprofessional interviewer\u201d. You already know you won\u2019t be staying in the same place forever, so what\u2019s the harm in having a conversation about other job opportunities? If you interview for positions you are not necessarily wanting to accept, it will be that much easier to interview for jobs you\u2019re very interested in.</p><p>Always make sure to keep your options open. It really sets you up for success when it comes to embracing tip #10.</p><p><em>And lastly\u2026</em></p><h4 id=\"10-make-sure-you-and-your-family-are-1-always-\"><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Make sure you and your family are #1. ALWAYS.</strong></h4><p>This is truly the beginning of one of the biggest adventures of your life. You\u2019re in far too great of a field to hate your job and that\u2019s an amazing thing. If I\u2019ve learned anything these last three years, I would say that nothing is worth sacrificing my relationships for; not even a really great paying job.</p><p>You have one of the most sought-after skill sets in the world right now\u2026 don\u2019t forget that.</p><p>Once you\u2019ve landed that first job, getting the next will be that much easier. The idea of leaving a job that has taught you so much can be scary but remember that at the end of the day capitalism doesn\u2019t play well with sentimentality.</p><p>In a world that changes quickly, it is important to put yourself and your continuing education as a priority in your continual job hunt. The better of a position you\u2019re able to put yourself in, the better you\u2019ll be able to take care of your family and your future; and at the end of the day that\u2019s the most important thing.</p><figure><img alt=\"o0SEaPHTqhPN5XIAAw81vz8-d31wnzVBHu1M\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/o0SEaPHTqhPN5XIAAw81vz8-d31wnzVBHu1M\" width=\"800\"/><figcaption>Myself outside of Slalom Consulting LLC (Saint Louis, MO), my first employer as a Software Engineer.

Know what you\u2019re looking for.Though you may not know exactly what you want to do for the rest of your life, you will probably know the type of hours you want to work during the week, the salary you will expect and whether or not you will want/need benefits.One of the biggest things I discovered when I entered the industry was the differences between full-time employees and contractors. Though the titles themselves don\u2019t inherently have a difference in the work at hand, it will affect how much you get paid, time-off, benefits, and overall job security. Before you begin your search and negotiating your salary, write down the things that you\u2019ll need to take into consideration:Do you have any big vacations in the near future?How often do you need your paycheck?How much do you spend each month? Personal? Bills? Other responsibilities?Are you planning on moving anytime soon?Some individuals wish for a full-time position with a certain organization (full benefits, PTO, and holidays off), but you may have to work as a contractor there before the employer is willing to hire you full-time. Research the market in your area while you are networking. You might be financially flexible now but require more stability in a few years, you never know.Also\u2026 important tidbit.Wherever you land, the likelihood of you being there for more than 3 years is very low. In 2017, the Software Engineering industry had the highest turnover of any other industry, and for good reason. Between the demand and the rising compensation to entice talented engineers, the cost of your time will significantly increase the more you work. Take this into consideration as you look forward to accepting your first position; you probably won\u2019t be there forever, so what are some compromises you can make for a year or two?\u201cContract vs. Full-time\u201d \u2014 https://blog.toggl.com/contract-vs-full-time/6. Your worth != what you\u2019ll be paidOne of the most difficult pieces of advice for me to accept was the reality that the salary I am offered will not directly equal my worth as a professional.Hypothetically, let\u2019s say I am great candidate for an entry-level position. I\u2019m hard-working, eager, and willing to learn and I\u2019m worth a specific amount in the workforce. Though this is very logical thinking, it isn\u2019t necessarily how businesses think when it comes to salary negotiation. Despite their eagerness to get talented developers, they are still in the business of making a profit. Which can mean offering a lower salary to someone who\u2019s willing to accept it.You might need to view your potential salary as \u201chow much will get me motivated to go to work in the morning\u201d versus \u201chow much am I \u2018worth\u2019\u201d. This change in mindset can save your self-esteem and stress-level as you begin salary negotiations. The likelihood of them aiming lower than you think you\u2019re \u2018worth\u2019 is high. As long as there are individuals willing to accept a lower salary, you will have a hard time finding someone who\u2019s willing to pay you what you think you are worth.Though this might be frustrating at first, understand that the number it takes you to \u201cget up in the morning\u201d will increase over time. You won\u2019t be at the low end of the pay scale forever. The more experience you have, the more power you will have in negotiating your salary. Rest assured that there are plenty of ways to climb in the technology industry.Glassdoor \u201cEntry Level Developer\u201d Salary Estimate \u2014 https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/entry-level-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htmGlassdoor \u201cKnow your worth\u201d Personal Estimate \u2014 https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/know-your-worth.htm7. Get familiar with testing and testing frameworksThough it\u2019s rarely covered in an undergraduate degree, software testing is something that you will encounter in almost every development job.As an engineer, your job is to develop great solutions alongside ensuring those solutions don\u2019t break previous functionality. Through utilizing testing frameworks, developers are able to identify when bugs produced in newly produced code.By addressing these issues early on, you can eliminate a large portion of the bugs a client may find through regular interaction with the product. Though you can never truly eliminate all bugs, you can take responsibility for the product by using testing best-practices.Testing can help you become a better developer. As Boris Beizer, an American software engineer and author, once said\u2026\u201cMore than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded \u2014 indeed, test-design thinking can discover and eliminate bugs at every stage in the creation of software, from conception to specification, to design, coding and the rest.\u201d\u201cWhat is Software Testing?

You will only discover these opportunities if you take the time to talk with them and ask!I graduated from a small, private university and even there I had an impressive amount of resources to aid me in securing my first job. Between resume reviewers, local company contacts, and even exclusive job opportunity postings, Universities have a wealth of resources. Let\u2019s not forget about job fairs that are constantly happening throughout the city! Take the time and investigate the resources available. You might be pleasantly surprised at the help they provide.9. Interview oftenOftentimes, we put an extreme amount of pressure on ourselves during a job search. If you\u2019re anything like me, interviews are anxiety producing, nerve-wracking, and an overall unpleasant experience. However, all of this is simply because of inexperience in the actual act of interviewing itself. If you\u2019re not comfortable in who you\u2019re speaking with and knowledgeable of what exactly they\u2019re looking for, you are going to be nervous! What\u2019s the best way to combat interview anxiety? \u2026 More interviews.Throughout your career you are going to work in numerous places so it will benefit you to become a \u201cprofessional interviewer\u201d. You already know you won\u2019t be staying in the same place forever, so what\u2019s the harm in having a conversation about other job opportunities? If you interview for positions you are not necessarily wanting to accept, it will be that much easier to interview for jobs you\u2019re very interested in.Always make sure to keep your options open.

The better of a position you\u2019re able to put yourself in, the better you\u2019ll be able to take care of your family and your future; and at the end of the day that\u2019s the most important thing.Myself outside of Slalom Consulting LLC (Saint Louis, MO), my first employer as a Software Engineer.
