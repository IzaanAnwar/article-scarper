Let's understand what they mean:</p><ol><li>Horizontal Offset: <code>1px</code> in the above example. This indicates how far the shadow will be from the card horizontally. Positive means to the right, negative means to the left.</li><li>Vertical Offset: <code>2px</code> in the above example. This indicates how far the shadow will be from the card vertically. Positive means to the bottom, negative means to the top.</li><li>Blur: <code>3px</code> in the above example. This indicates how blurry the shadow will look. Higher radius means more blur.</li><li>Spread: <code>4px</code> in the above example. This indicates how far the shadow will spread in all directions.</li><li>Color: <code>rgba(20,20,20,0.4)</code> in the above example. This determines the color of the shadow. If not supplied, the default text color will be used. Color values can be Hex, RGB, or HSL.</li></ol><p>Let's see the above code in action:</p><figure></figure><h2 id=\"how-box-shadows-affect-cards\">How Box Shadows Affect Cards</h2><p>Consider the two examples here:</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM\" height=\"780\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.34.18-PM.png 1720w\" width=\"1720\"/></figure><div><p>The first example has no box shadow, while the second example has a box shadow. The second one appears to be popping out of the screen (that makes it stand out a little as compared to the first one.)</p><p>So, if you need your cards to stand out, box shadows can help you make them really pop.</p></div><p>Let's say you're building an e-commerce application and you want your product cards to stand out. Box shadows can help you achieve this and get your customers to notice your products. </p><p>Even if your web application requires your cards to be subtle, you can always go with subtle box shadows to give a more pleasing aesthetic feel to the cards.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-multiple-layers-of-box-shadows\"><strong>How to Use Multiple Layers Of Box Shadows</strong></h2><p>You can use more than one layer of box shadows in your cards \u2013 and you'll likely do this a lot.</p><p>The syntax to create multiple layers of box shadows look like this:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>box-shadow: rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.4) -5px 5px, rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.3) -10px 10px, rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.2) -15px 15px, rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.1) -20px 20px, rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.05) -25px 25px;</code></pre><div><p>Each individual box shadow is separated by a comma (<code>,</code>). You can add as many as you want but I recommend to limit yourself to at most 5.</p><p>The above example looks something like this:</p></div><figure></figure><p>Notice the 5 layers beneath the cards that are in descending order of opacity. When done correctly, it can give a different look altogether to your cards. </p><div><p>Now this specific card might not look perfect because it is designed to explain a certain concept. But let's make it more interesting by adding colors to the shadows.</p><p>Remember we talked about adding colors by using the <code>rgba()</code> syntax? Let's put it to use here.</p></div><figure></figure><p>Here, Instead of using the values <code>rgba(0,0,0,0,2)</code> which indicates the color (Black in this snippet), I replaced it with <code>rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.2)</code> with varying opacity in decreasing order. This is one way of adding colors \u2013 the limit is your imagination.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-colored-box-shadows\"><strong>How to Use Colored Box Shadows </strong></h2><p>Even though colors can help you by making your cards stand out visually, they're not always the best option. Sometimes, a plain gray shadow works wonders on a white background. But this totally depends on the theme of your website.</p><div><p>Consider a simple blog application with lots of whitespace and general text content. If you have a card that displays blogs on the website, the best way will be to add a simple yet subtle box shadow to the cards to give them a good pop.</p><p>For example: consider the below cards taken directly from my <a href=\"https://manuarora.in/\">website</a>, where I have listed out all the blogs that I've written for freeCodeCamp so far.</p></div><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM\" height=\"1296\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM.png\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-02-at-7.57.17-PM.png 1844w\" width=\"1844\"/></figure><p>My website is simple and does one job \u2013 it showcases my personality and what I do. If I go on to add a red box shadow to the above boxes, it might not look that good. But if I use gray shadow with some amount of blur, it just helps it stand out without being too in-your-face.</p><p>So how do you use them correctly? Let's look at an example.</p><figure></figure><p>In the above example:</p><ul><li>Background color: <code>rgb(251 113 133);</code></li><li>Box Shadow: <code>box-shadow: rgba(254, 205, 211, 0.1) 0px 4px 16px, rgba(254,205,211,0.1) 0px 8px 24px, rgba(254,205,211, 0.1) 0px 16px 56px;</code></li></ul><p>The box shadow is a lighter shade of the background color that we used in the above example. And there are three layers of shadows. </p><p>When we have a background color, it's generally a good idea to have colored shadows of a lighter shade of the background color that is being used. This looks better than having a plain white or black shadow.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-inner-shadows\"><strong>How to Use Inner Shadows</strong></h2><p>All the above examples covered shadows that were 'outside' of the card that we were trying to style. But what if we wanted to have shadows on the inside?</p><p>You can use <code>inset</code> box shadows if you want to have box shadows within the holding container.</p><p>Consider the below example:</p><figure></figure><p>The code for the shadow is: </p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>box-shadow: rgb(204, 219, 232) 3px 3px 6px 0px inset, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5) -3px -3px 6px 1px inset;</code></pre><p>The keyword <code>inset</code> is used to specify that we want to use the shadow <code>inwards</code> and not the default behaviour that is <code>outwards</code>.</p><p>You can cleverly use inward box shadows in your web applications that have some important information to display.
